            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Should needleſly ſhew my ſelf a Non Conformiſt, if I ſhould ſend thee into the book without prefacing ſomething concerning the Author, matter, and occaſion, of what is here expoſed to thy view: For the Author, thou art entreated to look upon him, as one who loves not to ſee his face in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters, but would gladly ſpend his All upon thoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental practical truths, in which all ſincere Chriſtians are agreed, having ſadly obſerved all along this diſputing Age, that the best of men in handling Controverſies, have diſcovered more corruption in themſelves, then miſtake in their Adverſaries; nor haſt thou any reaſon to be offended, that he hath concealed his Name, which is publiſhed, would not have advantaged the Treatiſe, but rather have prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome againſt the reading of it, and tempted the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:51480:4"/>(if any one count ſo ſlight a piece worth anſwering) to make perſonal reflections, with which mens writings now a dayes are as full, as is the night of darkneſs: The matter diſcourſed of, is <hi>Re-ordination,</hi> a thing as generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the ancient Church, as Re baptization, yet now hugely juſtified, even to the cenſuring of all thoſe who cannot ſubmit to it. Men Renowned for their Piety and Learning, men that have been Ordainers of others lead the way, and thoſe who have been ordained by them follow after, never conſidering whether the nature of the Ordinance be not ſuch as makes it uniterable, nor whether they ſhall not hereby juſtifie the rigid Prelatiſts in all their hard ſpeeches againſt Presbyterian Ordination; for why ſhould they be blamed who called it a Mock-Ordination, ſeeing the men who gave and received it, are content to let it be accounted ſuch, taking the very ſame Orders that they do who were never looked upon as Miniſters? all the Anſwer that is given is, that they do not renounce their former Ordination, nay, they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that they look upon it as valid, only they take a Confirmation from the Biſhop, a Licenſe, as it were, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that Miniſterial Authority which hath been already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them: But one would think rational men ſhould not ſo eaſily ſuffer themſelves to be deceived, Is there any thing in that form and manner of making and conſecrating Priests and Deacons, that looks like a bare Confirmation? Are not all things ſo contrived and managed, that Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Ordained would be ridiculous, if they ſhould intend any thing leſs then the conferring of the <hi>eſſe Miniſteriale. I preſent unto you, Reverend Father in God, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent, to be admitted Deacons.</hi> If any one here can help himſelf by a mental reſervation, and ſay, that he is preſented to be admitted Deacon, which he is already, yet when preſently after the Biſhop ſaith, <hi>Brethren, if there be any of you, who knoweth any impediment, or notable
<pb facs="tcp:51480:4"/>crime in any of theſe perſons preſented to be ordered Deacons,</hi> ſure he cannot think, that to be ordered <hi>Deacon,</hi> is only to be confirmed <hi>Deacon.</hi> Likewiſe, in the form by which a man is made Priest, there are many phraſes uſed, which make it not at all to look like an <hi>admiſſion, ad eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem gradum;</hi> and the very fees themſelves that are paid, declare it to be ſomething more. As for the occaſion of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what is now publiſhed, thou mayeſt ſoon perceive it was the Letter of a Friend, deſiring the Authors judgement in the caſe: it is now publiſhed, to this end, that if any one be of a contrary mind, he may be induced to let us know his own reaſons, and his Anſwers to ours, and this will be a work of high charity, to convert us from ſuch an errour, as is like to hinder us from exerciſing our Miniſtry. But let not any man think, he ſhall be able to convert us by railing, by bitter jeers, or Sarcaſmes; <hi>the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> We ſhall think the cauſe is but weak, which muſt be ſupported by opprobrious language. This, good Reader, is all the trouble that is thought meet to be given thee by way of Preface. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem!</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat when you were invited to the conſtant preaching of the Word, I perſwaded you to be ordained, is no matter of my repentance, nor need it be any matter of your repentance, that things ſtanding as they then did, you made choice to be ordained by <hi>meer Presbyters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had in my eye that of the Apoſtle, <hi>How ſhall they preach, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be ſent, Rom.</hi> 10.15. that of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they propheſied;</hi> v. 32. <hi>I ſent them not, nor commanded them,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51480:6"/>therefore they ſhall not profit this people, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Nor could I forget what holy, zealous <hi>Luther,</hi> hath in his Commentary on the <hi>Galathians: Non ſatis eſt habere verbum &amp; puram doctrinam; aportet etiam ut vocatio certa ſit, ſine qua qui ingreditur, ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctandum &amp; perdendum venit, nunquam enim fortunat Deus laborem eorum, qui non ſunt vocati, &amp; quanquam quaedam ſalutaria afferunt, tamen nihil aedificant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You, 'tis like, had in your thoughts the example of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Reformed Churches, and the judgement of our own Proteſtant Divines at home unanimouſly, till of late, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Ordination</hi> by <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be valid.</p>
            <p>But now it ſeems you begin to queſtion, whether you may not do that which will be a virtual and interpretative renouncing of your former Orders, take a ſecond Ordination from ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and his Chaplains; the grounds you go upon are: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elſe it will not be poſſible to get any preferment in the Church: 3. Becauſe ſome that were voiced formerly to have more of the Presbyterian in them then you, have already actually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſuch a ſecond Ordination.</p>
            <p>To deal plainly with you, either you are not the man that I have ever taken you to be, or elſe you have alway had <hi>pectus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratum</hi> againſt all objections of this nature; either you did not ſit down and conſider before hand, what it would coſt you to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, or it is not poſſible that the two things you mention ſhould weigh much with you.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the <hi>Anabaptiſtical Sectarian Phrenſie</hi> ſhould have ſo poſſeſſed the late <hi>Governours,</hi> as that they would have collated no livings but on thoſe, who though baptized in infancy, would afterwards take a ſecond baptiſm at adult years. Suppoſe alſo that ſome learned, and ſeemingly godly men had yielded to Re-baptization, would you forthwith have betaken your ſelf to ſome pond or river, and been dipped <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt?</hi> If ſo, then your Religion is very much at the mercy of your Superiours, and we may thank the Parliament for your <hi>Orthodoxy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I preſume you will reply the caſe is different, that you may with better conſcience take a ſecond Ordination, then a ſecond Baptiſme: But I pray you where lies the difference? Is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme an Ordinance of God? ſo is Ordination: Is Baptiſme a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51480:6"/>Sacrament? ſo is not Ordination in the ſtrict ſenſe, but <hi>quid hoc ad Iphicli boves?</hi> It might be a Sacrament, and yet be iterable; for the Lords Supper is in the moſt proper and ſtrict notion a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and yet by the appointment of God it is to be received more then once by all that have opportunity: That Ordination is not a Sacrament, makes it not iterable, becauſe the end unto which it is by God appointed, is ſufficiently attained by one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it, and the end of Ordination being once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to receive it a ſecond time, would be to take an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God in vain, as I ſhall by and by have occaſion to prove more largely.</p>
            <p>For this is the method I intend to uſe with you:
<list>
                  <item>1. To ſhew that you ought not to take Ordination from the Biſhop, except your Ordination by Presbyters was a meer nullity, and in <hi>natura rei</hi> invalid.</item>
                  <item>2. To ſhew that your Ordination by Presbyters was not, cannot be rationally accounted, a meer nullity: Theſe two things done, 'twill not be difficult for you to gather my ſenſe about the caſe of conſcience by you propounded.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, I muſt premiſe two or three <hi>poſtulata,</hi> and they ſhall be ſuch things, as to ſave my ſelf a labour, I ſhall deſire may be granted, but if they ſhould not be granted, I ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eaſily to prove them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I ſuppoſe that you are certain, you were ordained by <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi> for if there could be an invincible doubt, whether you were <hi>de facto,</hi> ordained or no, I ſhould then grant you might for ſureneſs ſake be ordained in an Hypothetical form, <hi>ſi non ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſis,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>2. I ſuppoſe that when you were ordained by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſuch a form of words was uſed as made you a Miniſter, not of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but of the Catholick Church, for had you been made Miniſter only of that particular Church unto which you were firſt called, then your relation to that Church ceaſing, you ceaſed to be a Miniſter, and ſo are returned to the condition of a private Chriſtian; and therefore you know that the <hi>rigid</hi> ſort of <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> do judge, that when their <hi>Paſtor</hi> preacheth out of his own Congregation, he preacheth only as <hi>a gifted Brother,</hi> and <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> not as a <hi>Church-Officer,</hi> or <hi>authoritativè.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. I ſuppoſe that if you be ordained by a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> you are to be ordained in ſuch a form of words as is uſed when men are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51480:7"/>made <hi>ex non Miniſtris, Miniſtri, ex non Clericis, Clerici.</hi> This I ſuppoſe, becauſe I have all along heard, that as many as have been re-ordained by the Biſhops, have been by them looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſidered as <hi>Laicks,</hi> being firſt made <hi>Deacons,</hi> then <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the very ſelf-ſame form and order that they are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who never had any Conſecration to the <hi>Ministerial Office.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Were your former Ordination only to be compleated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, I would not inject the leaſt ſcruple into your mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know, that though your Ordination by Presbyters was lawful, and ſufficient to make you a Miniſter, yet it was perhaps not exactly <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>Canonical</hi> (at leaſt, if there be any Law extant in <hi>England,</hi> declaring thoſe, and thoſe only that are ordained by Biſhops, to be lawfully ordained) &amp; 'tis but prudential to procure ſome inſtrument to ratifie that which pieviſh people will be apt to take exception againſt.</p>
            <p>You know the <hi>late Parliament</hi> hath made an <hi>Act,</hi> in and by which, all, whether ordained by <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their livings, though not inſtituted and inducted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter of Laws in force, before theſe moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py unnatural diviſions. In this Act Miniſters rejoyce, and plead it againſt thoſe who diſturb them, yet do not think that they have been all this while <hi>Intruders,</hi> and <hi>Uſurpers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Semblably would our Prelates ſo far conſult either their own credit, or the peace of the Church, as to emit a general confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all Ordinations by Presbyters, provided that the perſons ſo ordained, be upon examination found ſufficient, ſuch a confirmation would not only be ſubmitted to, but alſo moſt thankfully received, for in ſo doing we ſhould ſtop the mouths of gain-ſayers, and yet give no occaſion to our friends to call into queſtion the validity of any Miniſterial Acts done by us all this while.</p>
            <p>Nor would I in the leaſt diſlike it, if our Biſhops (ſuch of them as are holy, and may be ſuppoſed to have any intereſt and favour at the Throne of Grace) would when any are removed to a new charge, call their Presbyters, and pray for a bleſſing upon the endeavours of perſons ſo removed, yea, and lay hands on them. I am much miſtaken, or elſe ſuch a practiſe may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2, 3. <hi>As they miniſtred and faſted, the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate now unto me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51480:7"/>whereunto I have called them; and when they had faſted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they ſent them away.</hi> You need not tell me that <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and ſome other Commentators of good eſteem, do underſtand this place of Ordination to an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office, I know they do; but yet ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle before this time, ſeeing he expreſly affirmeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>that he was an Apoſtle not of men, neither of man, but by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo 'tis not ſaid, ſeparate unto me for the office, but for the work (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) whereunto I have called: I judge it moſt probable, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is there ſpoken of, was not <hi>Ordinativa,</hi> but <hi>Optativa.</hi> Of this judgement is the learned <hi>Samuel Mareſius,</hi> in his Examen of ſome of the queſtions deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by our judicious <hi>Prideaux,</hi> p. 32. So was Mr. <hi>Richard Vines</hi> in his excellent Sermon before the Parliament, upon the day of humiliation for the growth of <hi>Errors, Hereſies, &amp;c.</hi> p. 16. where you may find him alſo quoting <hi>Spalato, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Rep. Eccl. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>parag.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>But this I ſay, <hi>that he who hath once been ordained to the office and order of a Presbyter, and knows himſelf ſo to be, ought not by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Ordination to be ſet apart to the ſame office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I prove to you 1. from the (ſo called) Canons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Can. 67. <hi>Si quis Epiſcopus, aut Presbyter, aut Diaconus ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ab aliquo Ordinationem ſuſceperit, deponitor tam ipſe, quam qui ipſum ordinavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Authority and Antiquity of theſe Canons I will not contend with you, Dr. <hi>H.H.</hi> in his Reply to Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> p. 10. acknowledgeth. that they were not written by the Apoſtles, nor by <hi>Clemens</hi> at the appointment of the Apoſtles, p. 12. and that his meaning in calling the ſecond Canon <hi>genuine,</hi> was only to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that it was not one of thoſe 35 later Canons that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by learned men <hi>Novitii</hi> and <hi>Adulterate.</hi> The truth is, the opinion and eſteem of the Latin and Greek Church hath been very differing and contrary, concerning theſe Canons: 'Tis certain, that the Synod aſſembled in <hi>Trul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Can.</hi> 2. ſpeaks honourably of all the eighty five Canons, for theſe are the words they uſe, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51480:8"/>But a Synod at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the year 494. decrees, that theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, as well the firſt fifty, as the other thirty five, are all ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and to be reckoned among thoſe writings <hi>quae ab Haereticis ſive Schiſmaticis conſcripta vel praedicata ſunt, quae<expan>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I argue ſecondly from the practiſe of our Engliſh Church, If any one had received Ordination from the Papiſts, though ſuch an Ordination be very corrupt, very ſuperſtitious, yet becauſe it was judged valid, the party who had received it, was on his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion looked upon as a Miniſter, and admitted to exerciſe all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices miniſterial, without any new Ordination. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if any one in the <hi>Marian Perſecution</hi> was ordained beyond the Seas, I find not that it was required of him, that he ſhould be again ordained according to the form and mode uſed in the Engliſh Churches.</p>
            <p>I could name you hundreds that were acknowledged as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſuffered quietly to enjoy Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, and to perform all ſacerdotal offices, meerly on the ſcore of their Ordination by Presbyters beyond the Seas, or in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But leſt I ſhould be tedious, I ſhall only mind you of one example related in the Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> penned by <hi>A. Biſhop Spotſwood, When ſome were to be ordained Biſhops for</hi> Scotland <hi>at</hi> London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, Anno Dom. 1609. <hi>a queſtion was moved by</hi> Lancelot An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Ely, <hi>touching the Conſecration of the Scottiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who, as he ſaid, muſt firſt be ordained Presbyters, as having received no Ordination from a Biſhop; the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <hi>Dr.</hi> Bancroft, <hi>who was by, maintained, that thereof there was no neceſſity, ſeeing where Biſhops could not be had, the Ordination gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Presbyters muſt be esteemed lawful. This applauded to by the other Biſhops,</hi> Ely <hi>acquieſced, and at the day, and in the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the three Scottiſh Biſhops were Conſecrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51480:8"/>
            <p>In which ſtory I deſire you to take notice, that the ground of Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> queſtion, whether they were not to be made Prieſts before they were conſecrated Biſhops, was his ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that having been ordained by meer Prieſts, they were not Prieſts: When it was once carried againſt him, that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Prieſts was valid and lawful, he without ſcruple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Conſecration of them, though never made Prieſts in the way that Prieſts are made in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was alſo told, that in the late conference before his Majeſty, when it was moved, that they who had been ordained by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, during the late diſtraction, might not be compelled to take any other Ordination: The Epiſcopal Divines refuſed to yield to that motion, and being preſſed with the judgement of Antiquity againſt Reordination; they anſwered, that in calling ſuch perſons to be ordained by a Biſhop, they did not call them to Reordination, but to Ordination, their former Ordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only irregular, and non-Canonical, but alſo null: And had they not fled to this, they muſt of neceſſity have been brought to repeat the Ordinations, that during the diſtractions, were made by Biſhops, they being not done without manifold irregularities, as to time or place, or ſome other ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>I prove thirdly, that he who is ordained with a valid ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ought not to be again reordained, becauſe by ſubmitting to ſuch reordination, he doth take an Ordinance of God in vain: You are not of the number of thoſe who deny Ordination to be an Ordinance of God, if you be, I muſt turn you over to D.<hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> M. <hi>Lyford,</hi> the <hi>London Miniſters,</hi> who have largely diſcuſſed that queſtion, and irrefragably proved, that Ordination is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that no man can ordinarily, without breach of Gods Law; enter the Miniſtry without it: You will rather ſay, that by being reordained, a man doth not contract the guilt of taking an Ordinance of God in vain; but if that be your anſwer, I thus aſſault you, <hi>To take an Ordinance of God either for no end, or for no ſuch end as God hath appointed it unto, is to take an Ordinance of God in vain;</hi> but <hi>to be reordained after preceding valid Ordination, is to take an Ordinance of God either to no end, or to no ſuch end as he hath appointed it unto. Ergo.</hi> If either Propoſition need confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is the minor; but of the truth of that you will not long
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51480:9"/>doubt, if you will but a little conſider what the end of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and that cannot better be gathered, then from the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions that are uſually given of Ordination, they are to this purpoſe, <hi>Ordination is an act, whereby in the Name of Chriſt, meet perſons are ſeparate and ſet apart to the work and office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi> Now I ask when you were ordained, were you thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſet apart or not? If you were not, then you were not ordained; if you were, what uſe ſerves your reordination unto? Perhaps you'l ſay, by that means you ſhall procure inſtitution from the Biſhops, and be the more acceptable to the people: But I pray you, where do you find any (I will not ſay precept, but) allowance of God, to take Ordination to ſatisfie the humour of unreaſonable men? what example in Antiquity to incourage you to ſuch a compliance? Friend, think on't impartially, was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, conveyed to you by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery? if it was not, you have much to anſwer, for taking upon you to command the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve you as one of Chriſts Embaſſadors, they might have told you, that they were as much Embaſſadors as your ſelf; if it was, do you think it would be any thing leſs then <hi>ludere ſacris,</hi> to ſubmit to another examination, and to have the Biſhop and his Chaplains pray, that you may now receive that gift?</p>
            <p>I will conclude this firſt head of my diſcourſe, when I have firſt minded you, that it is not long ſince, through the iniquity of the times, ſome Epiſcopally ordained, were conſtrained to have their reſidence either in the <hi>Gallican</hi> or <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, where there is no Ordination but by Presbyters, would theſe Divines have been content to be reordained after the mode of thoſe Churches, before they had been permitted to receive the double honour due to them as Miniſters? if they would not, (as I preſume they would not) why do they require that from others, which they would not have been content others ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them?</p>
            <p>If you ſhould plead on their behalf, that their Ordination was valid, ſo is not Ordination by Presbyters; that I ſhall prove to be falſe and Popiſh by and by.</p>
            <p>If ſecondly you ſhould alledge, that our Prelatiſts would not require reordination from Divines ordained beyond the Seas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not in a capacity to receive Ordination from a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51480:9"/>Biſhop, but ſo were we that lived in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be looked upon and dealt with as <hi>Laicks,</hi> till we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of our Schiſme and Hereſie, and that there's no better way to manifeſt our repentance, then by humbling our ſelves, and receiving orders from them.</p>
            <p>Unto this allegation I have two things to ſay: 1. Suppoſing, (but not granting) that it was Schiſme for our young Divines to take Orders from Presbyters, when as with ſome little coſt and trouble they might have received them from ſome Biſhop. I ſay, that mens being Schiſmaticks, doth not invalidate or make null either the Orders which they give or receive, nor hath the Church of God ever been wont to puniſh Schiſme, by compelling the Schiſmatick to receive new Orders: For this, you may pleaſe to read <hi>Gisber. Voetius Deſper. cauſa Papat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ſec.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13, 14. Nay, nor do our Epiſcoparians call ſuch as were ordained by Epiſcopal hands to reordination, though ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of them have fallen off from their Government, and joyned in with Presbyterians, which yet they muſt have done, if Schiſme do evacuate and annihilate their Orders; if by being ordained by Presbyters, we fell into Schiſme, repentance, and the bloud of Chriſt muſt take off the guilt of that ſin, not reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and paying fees to the Biſhop, or his Officers.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I am ſtill ſo blind, as not to ſee, that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Schiſme to be ordained by Presbyters, for all Schiſme is ſin, and all ſin is a tranſgreſſion of ſome good and righteous Law; but there was no tranſgreſſion of any good righteous Law, in receiving orders from Presbyters, for if ſo, then either of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or humane Law; not of a divine, for there is not a Law of God requiring us not to be ordained by any but a Biſhop; not of humane Law: For
<list>
                  <item>1. I cannot find any Law of the Nation enacting, that all Ordinations ſhall be made by a Biſhop, and his Presbyters, and no otherwayes.</item>
                  <item>2. If there had been any ſuch Law, it might be queſtioned, whether it could oblige the conſcience in ſuch times of confuſion as we were fallen into.</item>

If a man had been ordained by a Biſhop in thoſe daies, he could not have got any Ordination every way argeeable to the Laws of the Land: Our Biſhops tell us, that the Canons of 1603. are Law, if they be ſo, they themſelves, during the late diſtractions, did tranſgreſs them with a witneſs: What if I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51480:10"/>ſhould further add, that ſeeing our Biſhops had clogged Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Subſcription to things unneceſſary, diſputable, to our apprehenſion ſinful, they are the Schiſmaticks who enjoyn ſuch Subſcriptions, not we who refuſe them.</item>

Several weighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove this, might be tranſcribed out of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> his Tract of Schiſme, a Diſcourſe ſo ſolid, and yet become ſo ſcarce, that if in ſtead of being re-ordained your ſelf, you would get that reprinted, it would much oblige me.</p>
            <p>But it is time to come to the Second Part of my Task; which is to ſhew, That Ordination by Presbyters is valid: which I ſhall endeavour by theſe following Arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If Presbyters and Biſhops be not different in Order, then Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Presbyters is valid: But Presbyters and Biſhops are not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in Order,</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of the Major is founded on that Maxim, ſo frequently uſed by the moſt Reverend <hi>Uſher, Ordinis eſt conferre Ordines;</hi> Propoſition ſo evident, that it is acknowledged even by Dr. <hi>H. Ferne,</hi> one of the greateſt upholders of the lately decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Epiſcopacy, in his Compendious Diſcourſe, <hi>Page</hi> 115, 116, 117, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Minor, That Presbyters and Biſhops are of the ſame, and not a different Order, ſhall be proved by as good Authority and Teſtimony, as is produced, or can be expected in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of this Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> It ſhall be ſhewed, that this was the general Sentiment.

            <p>In writing of the Judgment of ſuch Divines as are commonly called Reformed and Proteſtant, I might be large: Indeed I ſcarce know one againſt me. The Late Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when he was to anſwer for his Degree, did give this for one of his Queſtions, <hi>An Epiſcopatus ſit Ordo diſtinctus? Affir.</hi> But he was ſufficiently checked for that Heterodoxy, by Dr. <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Regius Profeſſor,</hi> as you may find in Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Hiſtory of him. If you ſhould be ſo curious, as to ask whence Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> had that Relation? I can tell you, he had it from Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> who was preſent at the Diſputation. I can further aſſure you,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51480:10"/>that the Doctor of the Chair was ſo moved, that he told his Wife when he came home, that he had a Papiſt that day to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer under him in the Schooles. Setting him aſide, and ſome violent Followers of his, Proteſtants generally hold, that a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and a Biſhop do differ, <hi>Gradu,</hi> not <hi>Ordine:</hi> I'le not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with Quotations from the Tranſmarine Divines, leſt you ſhould ſay they did <gap reason="foreign">

Nor yet will I tranſcribe any thing from Dr. <hi>Field</hi> or Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> becauſe 'tis yielded, that theſe, and ſeveral others held Epiſcopacy to be only ſome ſuperiour Degree and Eminence. Mr. <hi>Francis Maſon</hi> renowned for his <hi>Defenſio Miniſterii Anglicani,</hi> hath in a ſet Diſcourſe maintained, that Epiſcopacy and Presbytery are not diſtinct Orders, and that therefore the Ordinations of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches beyond the Seas are good and valid.</p>
            <p>Go we to the Times of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, in which, he Foundations of our Reformation were firſt laid. You may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> Vol. 2. Pag. 658. Edit. London 1631. That that young <hi>Joſiah,</hi> by the Authority of his own Regal Lawes, appointed certain of the moſt Grave and beſt Learned Biſhops, and other of his Realm, to aſſemble together at his Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> there to argue and entreat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much I have longed to meet with an Author, from whom I might learn what was done at that Meeting; but could not hear of any one hat had met with any thing that might give me or others ſatisfaction, till of late caſting mine eye curſorily upon a Piece Publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Edward Stilling fleet,</hi> a very Judicious and Peaceable Divine, I underſtood, that by ſome ſingular Providence, there came to his hands an Authentick M.S. of the Proceedings here. From that, we are aſſured, that <hi>T. C. A.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> afterwards Martyr, gave it in as his Judgment, <hi>That Biſhops and Prieſts were at one time, and were not two things, but both one Office in the beginning of Chriſts Religion.</hi> And from the ſame M.S. it further appears, <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Aſaph, Therleby, Redman, Cox, <hi>all employed in that Convention, were of the ſame Opinion, that at firſt Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were the ſame;</hi> Redman <hi>and</hi> Cox <hi>expreſſely citing with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation the Judgment of</hi> Jerome. Of the ſame Judgment undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly were the Compoſers of that Tract, called the <hi>Inſtitution of a Chriſtian man,</hi> as may be ſeen in what they delivered about the (then ſo called) Sacrament of Orders. In a word, our Martyrs did
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51480:11"/>ſo generally opine, that Epiſcopacy was no ſuperiour Order to Presbytery, that Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria quinquarticular is,</hi> Part 2. <hi>p.</hi> 17. doth on purpoſe caution us that we ſhould not attribute too much to them, or meaſure the Doctrine of our Church by them, leſt we ſhould be forced to allow the parity or Identity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Biſhops and Prieſts, becauſe <hi>John Lambert</hi> (he might have named many others) did ſo conceive. <hi>In the Primitive Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there were no more Officers in the Church of God then Biſhops and Deacons, that is to ſay, Miniſters, as witneſſeth, beſide Scripture, St.</hi> Hierom <hi>in his Commentaries on the Epiſtles of St.</hi> Paul: <hi>Whereas thoſe whom we now call Prieſts, were all one and no other but Biſhops, and the Biſhops no other but Prieſts, men ancient both in age and Learning, ſo near as could be choſen; nor were they inſtituted and choſen as they be now a dayes, the Biſhop and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, only oppoſing them, whether they can construe a Collect: But they were choſen alſo with the conſent of the people amongſt whom they were to have their Living,</hi> as ſheweth St. <hi>Cyprian: But alack for pity ſuch Elections are baniſhed, and new Faſhions brought in.</hi> By which, ſaith the Doctor, Truly (if it may ſerve for a Rule) our Biſhops muſt be reduced to the Rank of Prieſts: But falſely doth he add, that then the right of Preſentation muſt be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the people, to the deſtruction of all the Patrons in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If I would produce all the Teſtimonies of the Learned among the Papiſts, my Papers would ſwell to too great a Bulk. D. <hi>Forbes</hi> the <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who hath deſerved well of the Hierarchy, doth amply prove, that it was the general Opinion of the Schoolmen, that Epiſcopacy and Presbytery are the ſame Order: See his <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renicum,</hi> Lib. 2. Cap. 11. P. 154, 155, 156, 157, 158. You may alſo have recourſe to Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> in the before commended Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning Ordination beyond the Seas by Presbyters. This alſo did ſo much ſtick with Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> that he would not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Epiſcopacy to be a ſuperiour Order, though he were by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> much preſſed ſo to do.

            <p>The Collection of Queſtions on the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was very anciently aſcribed to St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 'tis not now by Learned men thought to be his; but the Author, whoever he was, had Antiquity and Learning enough to ſet him above Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Theſe are ſome of his words, <hi>Quid eſt Epiſcopus, niſipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Presbyter, hoc eſt, ſummus Sacerdos?</hi> Now I pray you, do not theſe words plainly imply, that a Biſhop is but of the ſame Order with a Presbyter? Suppoſe you ſhould meet with theſe words in any ancient Author, <hi>Quid eſt Praeſidens, niſi primus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius?</hi> Would you not quickly thence infer, that that Author
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51480:12"/>judged the Preſident to be of no higher an Order then that of a Fellow?</p>

            <p>I muſt not conceal it from you, that Dr. <hi>Jer.

Thus therefore he, <hi>pag.</hi> 330. <hi>A Diſſent from a publick or a received Opinion, was never called Hereſie, unleſs the contrary Truth was indeed a part of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine: For the Fathers many of them did ſo; as St.</hi> Auſtin,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51480:12"/>
               <hi>from the Millenary Opinion; yet none did ever reckon them in the Catalogues of Hereticks; but ſuch things did only ſet them down there, which were either directly oppoſite to Catholick Faith, though</hi> in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noribus articulis, <hi>or to a holy Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is rather peremptory than ſatisfactory, If the Reverend Doctor had ſaid, that nothing <hi>ought</hi> to be called Hereſie, unleſs the contrary Truth was indeed a part of Catholick Doctrine, I might have let his Affirmation paſs without a cenſure. But to ſay, that never any thing ſet a man in the Catalogues of Hereticks made by <hi>Epiphanius, Auguſt. Philaſtrius,</hi> but what was either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to Catholick Belief, or to a holy life, is ſuch a —as hath ſcarce dropped from the Pen of a Learned man. What thinks he of the <hi>Quartodecimani?</hi> Was their Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a holy Life, or to the Catholick Belief? I trow not. Yet are they liſted among Hereticks. <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> alſo reckoneth thoſe in the number of Hereticks, who thought, that the breath of life was the rational Soul, and not the Grace of the holy Spirit: but I do not imagine, that the Doctor can think that this Opinion was either contrary to the publick Faith of the Church, or to holy Life. Let him proceed. <hi>p.</hi> 331. <hi>It is true that</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>and St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>reckon his denying Prayer for the dead, to be one of his own Opinions, and heretical; but I cannot help it if they did, let him and they agree it, they are able to anſwer for themſelves, but yet they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him alſo of Arianiſm, and ſhall we therefore ſay that Arianiſm was no Hereſie, becauſe the Fathers called him Heretick in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar upon a wrong Principle? We may as well ſay this, as deny the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then may not we alſo ſay, if <hi>Epiphan.</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his aſſerting the parity of Miniſters for hereſie, we cannot help it; let <hi>Aerius</hi> and they agree it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they miſcall one of his Opinions, therefore it may be, they did miſcall the other. If they juſtly accuſed him of Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, (which whether they did or no, I find Learned men to doubt) then indeed he was an Heretick; but it will not thence follow, that whatever elſe he held was Hereſie. He hath not yet done; for <hi>ibid. He was not condemned by any Council. No. For his Hereſie was ridiculous, and a ſcorn to all wiſe men, as</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius <hi>obſerves, and it made no long continuance, neither had it any conſiderable party.</hi> This is but juſt affirmed; and therefore it will be ſufficient Confutation to deny it. He that reads <hi>Hierom</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51480:13"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> will not think the Opinion ridiculous, or a ſcorn to all ſober men. I ſhall follow him no further: for what he brings out of the Canon of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is a huge Impertinence. Let it be Schiſme and Hereſie (which with the Fathers aſſembled in that Synod ſeem to be all one) to divide from Canonical Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (ſuch are not they who are neither choſen by the Clergy, nor by the People) and to ſet up Conventicles contrary to theirs: How will it hence follow, that it is Hereſie to hold that Presbytery and Epiſcopacy are the ſame Order? To as little purpoſe, or leſſe, is what follows out of the Council of <hi>Paris.</hi> And concerning the <hi>Acephali, p.</hi> 332, 333. The <hi>Acephali</hi> were ſo called, ſaith <hi>Iſidore,</hi> becauſe the Head, Chief, and Firſt of them, could not be found. That ſeems to be a miſtake, for <hi>Severus</hi> was the Head of them.

In Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Opinion, it is ſo far from being evident to any one reading the Holy Scriptures, that there were from the Apoſtles times theſe Orders of Miniſters in the Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, that he doth <hi>magno conatu</hi> endeavour to prove, that from no Teſtimony of Scripture it can be proved, that there were in the Apoſtles time any Prieſts or Presbyters in the notion in which the word Presbyter is now taken. He thinks that in the Apoſtolical Writings, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth conſtantly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a Biſhop, and that all the Churches, of which any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made in Scripture, were gouerned only by Biſhops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</item>

At leaſt he might have done well to conſider, that his ſo much magnified Objection is a ſtale one, and hath received its Anſwer from Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> in the before-commended Treatiſe. It moſt unhappily falls out, that I have not the Book at hand; but if my Memory fail me not, more then ordinarily it doth, the Author of the <hi>Neceſſity of Reformation,</hi> gives you his full ſenſe, if not his very words. That Book when it ſpeaks of the making of Biſhops, calls that <hi>a Conſecration, not an Ordination, as it doth when it ſpeaks of making Deacons and Presbyters; calling one the Manner and Form of Ordering Deacons; the other, the Form of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Prieſts: But when it speaks of the other, it changeth this word Ordering, and calls it the Form of Conſecrating an Archbiſhop or Biſhop; which ſhews plainly, that the Book of Ordination never means
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51480:14"/>to make Biſhops to be not only in Degree and Office of Prolocutor, but in a diſtinct Order of Chriſt and his Apoſtles Inſtitution, ſuperiour to a Presbyter. Indeed the Preface doth not ſay, theſe three Orders, but only theſe Orders of Miniſters, and in the Prayer, it is not ſaid, that the Biſhop is called to the Order, but to the Work and Miniſtry of a Biſhop.</hi>

            <p>I had thought, here to have concluded my firſt Argument: But there is one Medium ſeems to me ſo conſiderable, to prove that a Presbyter is of the ſame Order with a Biſhop, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit it. You know, that it was required that a Biſhop ſhould be Ordained by three Biſhops at leaſt: Yet <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> in the Life of Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> tells us, that he was Ordained <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 555. by two Biſhops and one Presbyter, who is by him called <hi>Andreas Oſtienſis.</hi> Doth it not hence manifeſtly appear, that the Church at that time took a presbyter to be of the ſame Order with a Biſhop, and impowered in caſe of neceſſity, to confer the very degree of Epiſcopacy? At this Example, the Learned Author of <hi>Epiſcopacy aſſerted,</hi> is very angry, and tels us, <hi>p.</hi> 166. That, <hi>Pelagius his taking in the Priest, was but to cheat the Canon, &amp; cozen himſelf into an impertinent Belief of a Canonical Ordination.</hi> Pelagius <hi>might as well not have had three, as not three Biſhops, and better, becauſe, ſo they were Biſhops, the firſt Canon of the Apoſtles approves the Ordination, if done by two.</hi> But this is too ſlight a way of anſwering Antiquity. We muſt not till we ſee better reaſon, think that <hi>Pelagius</hi> and the two Biſhops were ſo unworthy, as to go about to put a cheat on the Canon, or ſo wicked, as to make uſe of an hand, that being impoſed, ſignified no more then would the Impoſition of a Lay hand. Nor do I think, that in thoſe dayes it was counted an indifferent thing whether three concurred to the Ordination of a Biſhop or no: For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> requires three at leaſt, and the conſent of thoſe that are abſent ſignified by their Letter. And Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> in his fifth Epiſtle to the Biſhop of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and other Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, hath theſe words; <hi>quod Epiſcopi non ſint, qui minus quam atribus Ordinati ſunt, ordinati Epiſcopis, omnibus patet, quoniam ut bene noſtis. prohibitum a ſacris eſt partribus, ut qui ab u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51480:14"/>was decreed in <hi>haec verba; forma antiqua ſervabitur, ut non minus quam tres ſufficiant, qui fuerint a Metropolitano directi, ad Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copum Ordinandum:</hi> And this uſage they ſeem to have borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Synagogue, for it was a fundamental Conſtitution among the Jews, that Ordination of Presbyters, by laying on of hands, muſt be by three at leaſt, as may be ſeen, <hi>Miſna &amp; Gem. tit. Sanhe. cap.</hi> 1. By the way, I deſire you to take notice, how our Epiſcopal Brethren deal with us in this controverſie; they call upon us to ſhew them an example of a Presbyter lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands on a Biſhop; this caſe could not happen, but in the defect and abſence of Biſhops, for modeſty will not permit a Presbyter to lay on hands, Biſhops ſufficient to do the work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, and ſuch defects of Biſhops could be but very rare; but once we find there chanced to be ſuch a defect, and then a Church of no mean denomination thought a Presbyter ſufficient to do what a Biſhop was to do: Now when we bring this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they rail againſt it, and ſay, that it was done only in the want of a Biſhop, and it had better have been left undone.</p>
            <p>My ſecond argument to prove the validity of Ordination by Presbyters, I'le put into this form; <hi>Either Ordination by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters is valid, or elſe ſomething eſſential to Ordination is wanting in Ordination by Presbyters:</hi> But <hi>nothing eſſential to Ordination is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Ordination by Presbyters; ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major is evident, grounded on this plain Propoſition, that it is only ſome eſſential defect that can make a thing invalid or null; he that wants either body or ſoul, is no true man, he that hath them, is truly a man, though he want many of the integral parts which concur to the integrity and perfection of a man.</p>
            <p>The minor I thus prove, if any thing eſſential to Ordination be wanting in Ordination by Presbyters, it is either <hi>material, formal, final,</hi> or <hi>efficient cauſe;</hi> but <hi>neither of theſe is wanting, ergo,</hi> nothing eſſential is wanting.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>material, formal, final cauſes</hi> be what they will, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they may be found in Ordinations by Presbyters, as well as in Ordinations by a Biſhop, only we are told there is not a due efficient cauſe, for God hath appropriated Ordination to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and it cannot have its effect, if performed by any other then him that hath attained Epiſcopal Dignity.</p>
            <p>This being that foundation, upon which the confidence of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51480:15"/>thoſe who nullifie all Ordinations by Presbyters, whether at home or abroad, is built, I ſhall take liberty to enquire,

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51480:18"/>I underſtand not; I think that Chriſt did neither inſtitute Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops nor Presbyters, in this firſt or ſecond Miſſion.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Miſſions ſeem only temporary, and the 70, after their return, remained in the nature of private Diſciples, till after the Reſurrection they received a new Commiſſion to preach and plant Churches; and the twelve, after this Miſſion, muſt needs be but a kind of Probationers, till Chriſt ſolemnly authorized them, and gave them that plenitude of power, which we find him not to do, till after his Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21.</p>
            <p>Of any power of juriſdiction or order that the twelve had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſeventy, by virtue of their Miſſion, there is not the leaſt <hi>vola</hi> or <hi>veſtigium</hi> in Scripture; the ſeventy had their power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt, as had the twelve, and their Commiſſion was as full and large, as was the Commiſſion granted to the twelve, as will ſoon appear, by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. with <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>I obſerve indeed from <hi>John</hi> 4.2. that Chriſts Diſciples did baptize, but ſee no neceſſity of reſtraining that phraſe to the twelve, who were called his Diſciples; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Beſides, Chriſt in his adminiſtrations did, though in ſome

            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore a little view that text in St. <hi>John</hi> 1. there are who ſay, that in thoſe words, no Apoſtolical power is given, but only promiſed, <hi>As the Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you,</hi> i.e. ſaith <hi>Grotius, Brevi mittam praeſens pro futuro:</hi> In this Expoſition he is not ſingular, ſome antienter then himſelf, by many years, went that way before him; his, and their ground ſo to do, was the ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>I tell you the truth, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I judge, with <hi>Tolet,</hi> that Chriſts very breathing on them, makes it highly probable, that he gave them preſent Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Authority to that place, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>Cyril</hi> anſwers, that Chriſt did anticipate his promiſe, and that it was uſual with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51480:19"/>him to give before hand ſome <hi>ſpecimina</hi> of thoſe things which he promiſed to do after his return into heaven: Another obſerves, that Chriſt doth not ſay, if I depart, I will give him unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you; and that the ſpirit is not properly ſaid to be ſent, but when he appears in ſome viſible ſhape, which he did not till <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Diſciples did now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghoſt, yet they did not now receive <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But to whom is this Commiſſion given? ſurely to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, for though, as we read in the following verſes, <hi>Thomas</hi> was abſent at this apparition, yet his abſence notwithſtanding, the ſpirit might be,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Cyrillum.</hi>
               </note> and was given to him: When the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to be put on the ſeventy, it came upon <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> though they were in the Camp, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. The greateſt queſtion to me is, whether theſe words were ſpoken only to the eleven, and not alſo to the ſeventy, or at leaſt ſome of the ſeventy, becauſe I find, that the two Diſciples that were going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> told the joyful news of Chriſts Reſurrection to the eleven, and <hi>to them that were with them, Luke</hi> 24.33. <hi>And as they thus ſpake, Jeſus ſtood in the midſt of them, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you, ver.</hi> 35. Nor is there any thing in Saint <hi>John,</hi> that can neceſſitate me to think otherwiſe: yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, upon ſome other reaſons, I am content it ſhould be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that this Commiſſion was granted only to the eleven, as alſo that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19.</p>
            <p>But what hence can be gained, that will in the leaſt prejudice Presbyterians, I wot not, the Apoſtles were all equal, and for thoſe forty daies that Chriſt continued with them, it appears not that there were any Church-Officers beſides them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot from any action of Chriſt be collected, that there ought to be an inequality among the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ſuppoſeth that <hi>Matthias</hi> was one of the ſeventy, who was by the Apoſtles and Diſciples, or rather by God himſelf, deſigned and choſen to come into the room of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and this he calls <hi>Exemplum Presbyterianorum</hi>

            <p>But why he ſhould ſo call it, I know not, for the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not ſay, that there are not divers Orders in the Church, but only that there are not divers orders of Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and that <hi>Matthias</hi> his being choſen from a private Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be an Apoſtle, ſhould prove, that there are divers orders of preaching Miniſters, would be ſtrange.</p>
            <p>Indeed, ſhould Presbyterians grant the Biſhops do ſucceed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Presbyters do ſucceed the Seventy, then <hi>Matthias</hi> his being choſen to be an Apoſtle (ſuppoſing him to have been one of the Seventy) might with ſome colour be urged; but many Presbyterians there be, who grant no ſuch thing, nor doth Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> think, that the Seventy were Presbyters by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Miſſion: For he contends for the opinion of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> who makes ſeven of the ſeventy to be the men that were choſen Deacons, and further adds, that the reſt were made Evangeliſts, but that Evangeliſts and Deacons were much the ſame: <hi>In idem plane recidit quantum ad</hi> 70 <hi>Diſcipulos attinet ſive ad Evangeliſtarum, ſive ad Diaconatus gradum aſcendiſſe eos dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> page 159.</p>
            <p>Yet he thinks not meet to quit Chriſts making and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onating of the eleven Apoſtles, till it have afforded him an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for his Epiſcopacy, which is briefly propounded in his anſwer to the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, page 4. <hi>The power derived, as from God the Father to Chriſt, ſo from Chriſt to the Apoſtles, was derived to them, not as to a Common Councell of ſocial Rulers, but as ſo many ſeveral Planters and Governours of the Church, each having all power committed to him, and depending on no conjunction of any one or more Apoſtles for the exerciſe of it.</hi> This is more largely deduced in his Latine book againſt <hi>Blondell, Diſs.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Doctor hath no where put this argument into a ſyllogiſtical form, nor will I venture to do it, becauſe I am not able to frame out of it any concluſion that will any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Presbyterian plat-form of Government. Be it ſo, that a ſingle Apoſtle had power over the Churches planted by him, what is that to a ſingle Biſhops having <hi>power, ſole power</hi> of juriſdiction, not only over the <hi>Churches</hi> in his Dioceſs, but alſo over the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Rectors</hi> of thoſe Churches? 2. How doth it appear, that it was the mind of Chriſt, that any ſingle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51480:20"/>ſhould put forth his power of Ordination without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſome other or others, either <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical perſons,</hi> or Presbyters, in all the New Teſtament, I cannot find they did ſo, but I find many Inſtances and examples, by which it appears, that either they might not do ſo, or at leaſt did not think meet ſo to do. When <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Ordained,</hi> if <hi>Ordained,</hi> was it not by three? When <hi>Timothy,</hi> was it not by a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?</p>
            <p>But I will not go about further to fit a ſhooe to a foot I know not; only give me leave to tell you, that there is one Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis which I perceive, the Doctor laies much ſtreſſe upon in that and other Diſcourſes, the which, unleſs it be granted to him, (and Adverſaries are not now adayes ſo kind, as to grant much) he can never be able to prove: I'le give you it in his own words, <hi>Diſſer.</hi> p. 147, 148. ſpeaking of the words of Chriſt to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.

            <p>Well then, if there be no evidence that any ſuch were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, we ſhall think there were none ſuch; for <hi>de non exiſtenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; non apparentibus, eadem eſt ratio.</hi> And if there were no Presbyters, then there were no Biſhops exerciſing Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over Presbyters. And 'tis plain enough, that every worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Congregation had its Biſhop in the Apoſtles times.</p>
            <p>But the Reverend Doctor in his Anſwer to the <hi>London Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi> (as he cals them) <hi>p.</hi> 107. thus brings himſelf off; <hi>John I know was an Apoſtle, and John I believe, ordained Presbyters, and thence I doubt not to conclude the Apoſtolical Inſtitution,</hi> i. e. <hi>in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the divine Right of the Order of Presbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I alſo know that St. <hi>John</hi> was an Apoſtle; but what ſhould induce me to believe, that he inſtituted a ſecond ſort of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who were only to preach and adminiſter Sacraments, but had no power either of <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Juriſdiction?</hi> Muſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this with a Divine or humane Faith? If with a divine Faith, ſhew me ſome infallible Teſtimony for it. If an humane Faith be the greateſt and higheſt Faith a man can attain unto, what a pitiful pickle are the poor Presbyters in, that can only have ſome probable perſwaſion that their Order is <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> Who would take upon him the Office of a Presbyter, that can have no greater aſſurance that it was the mind of Chriſt, that there ſhould be any ſuch Office in the Church? Had <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in their Provinces power to inſtitute this ſecond Order of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as well as St. <hi>John</hi> in his? If they had not, how was their power equal? If they had, why did they not put it forth? It will not I ſuppoſe, be ſaid, they wanted care, but only that the number of Believers was not ſo increaſed, during their abode in the earthly Tabernacle, as to require ſuch kind of Presbyters. Well then they leaving the Churches by them planted, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Biſhop and Deacons, how will it be clearly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved, that it was thoſe Apoſtles intention, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who when they left him, had power over the Deacons and people only, ſhould when the Churches neceſſity did require, conſtitute Presbyters, and have power over them. This Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be manifeſted and declared from ſome paſſages in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or elſe it will not by Proteſtants be looked on as a Law of Chriſt, or as a thing of perpetual concernment to his Church: For either the Scripture is a ſufficient and full Record of Chriſts
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51480:21"/>univerſal Laws, or it hath not that Perfection, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their Controverſies with Catholicks, do aſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>But why do I ſtay ſo long about this? The place produced out of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> to prove that St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted theſe ſecondary Presbyters, proveth no ſuch thing.

            <p>You will now expect before I take my leave of the Arguments brought for Epiſcopacy, that I ſhould anſwer that brought from <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> For it is ſaid, that <hi>in all places Biſhops did ſucceed the Apoſtles.</hi> But this Argument I have alway accounted but ſlight, ſuch as will not weigh much with you, if you conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Queſtion is not whether Biſhops did ſucceed, but whether Biſhops exerciſing Juriſdiction over Presbyters?</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Catalogues that are brought of the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles were made by conjecture, and delivered down to us by men that lived at a great diſtance from the Apoſtolical times. Read the ingenuous Confeſſion of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> l. 3. c. 4. If he, ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in ſearching into antiquity, that he is by a Learned man of our own called <hi>the Father and Fountain of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> was at ſuch a loſs in the matter of Succeſſion, at what a loſs muſt they needs be that lived after him? Leſt this ſhould ſeem a meer ſhift, I will take notice of one Authority produced, I think by almoſt every one, who hath ingaged in the Epiſcopal Cauſe, but moſt magnified by Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſcopacy aſſerted.</hi> Theſe are his words, <hi>p.</hi> 79, 80. <hi>I ſhall tranſcribe no more testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51480:22"/>for this particular, but that of the General Council of</hi> Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>in the caſe of</hi> Baſſianus <hi>and</hi> Stephanus: Leontius <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Magneſia <hi>ſpake it in full Council,</hi>

               </gap>. The ſplendid Name of the <hi>General Council of Calcedon,</hi> made me curious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the very bottom of this Teſtimony. I have ſo done, and thus I find the matter to ſtand: The <hi>Calcedonian</hi> Council was called by the Emperour <hi>Martian,</hi> Anno 451. or 452. or 454. as ſome compute. In it, ſaith Dr. <hi>Prideaux, Matters were mostly tranſacted by favouring Parties between</hi> Leo <hi>the firſt of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Anatholius <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Conſtantinople; Let that paſs: In the 11th. Action of this Synod, I find in <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Crabbe,</hi> that <hi>Leontius</hi> did uſe the words that are quoted from him: But what was this <hi>Leontius?</hi>
               <q>A man, ſaith the L. <hi>Brooks,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Epiſcopacy, <hi>p.</hi> 66. whoſe Writings have not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him Famous to us, for Learning, nor his exemplary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs (mentioned by others) famous for Piety.</q> Surely not of Credit enough to ſway our Faith in this Point, becauſe he is contradicted and convicted of falſhood, by <hi>Philip,</hi> a Reverend Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and by <hi>Aetius,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, who inſtance in divers others beſides <hi>Baſilius,</hi> that had been Ordained by the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> So that the General Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> proves to be the Teſtimony but of one man, and of one who was either ignorant of the Truth, or elſe did love Falſhood. In a word, what is it in antiquity, from whence out Epiſcopal Brethren will argue the Divine right of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy? From the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or Biſhops: But we deny that thoſe whom the Ancients did call <hi>Epiſcopos,</hi> were Biſhops in our ſenſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> We deny, that they were looked on as having the ſole power of Juriſdiction and Order. Let the Prelatiſts prove, that for 1500 years, or for 800 years, <hi>Presbyters have been looked upon as poor inferiour Creatures, having only power to preach the Word, and not to adminiſter Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> I for my part, promiſe faithfully to yield the Cauſe; and my heart would even leap for joy, that I were ſo conquered: For I do aſſure you, it goes more againſt the hair with me, to put forth one act of Diſcipline, then to ſtudy twenty Sermons. Are our
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51480:22"/>Brethren offended with us, that we argue from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> in Eccleſiaſtical Writers? That is not fair play.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now give you my Arguments to prove that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is not of Divine Right, and they ſhall be two: The firſt, I ſhall caſt into the Form of a disjunctive Syllogiſme, thus; <hi>If Epiſcopacy be of Divine Right, then either the</hi> Romiſh <hi>or the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Epiſcopacy: But neither the</hi> Romiſh <hi>nor the</hi> Engliſh: <hi>Ergo, none at all.</hi> As for the Major, it contains a ſufficient enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For though there be Epiſcopacy of a different mode exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in other places, yet that Epiſcopacy which is eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches, and the Reformed <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, doth moſt pretend to Divine Right. You dodbtleſs will deny my Minor, and ſay, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Epiſcopacy is of Divine Right. But I prove it is not: thus, <hi>If our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Epiſcopacy be of divine Right, then either all the Circumſtances and Appendages are of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, or only the ſubſtance of it: But neither:</hi> Ergo. All the Circumſtances or Appendages of it, to be ſure, are not <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. their way of Election is not <hi>jure divino;</hi> ther's no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt for a <hi>Conge d'eſlire, I</hi> would not be thought to ſay, that the Magiſtrates interpoſing in making of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, is againſt the Law of Chriſt; I only ſay, that ther's no Law of Chriſt requiring, that the Civil Magiſtrate ſhould either make Biſhops, or require others to chuſe. I add, that we have no Primitive Example of ſuch a thing as a <hi>Conge d'eſlire.</hi> Rather we find, that all Biſhops were made and choſen, not without the conſent and ſuffrage of the Clergy, and all the people over whom he was to praeſide and govern.

The bleſſed <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith, that Church-Officers were made, the whole Church applauding or conſenting. Is there nothing in this Phraſe from whence <hi>Blondel</hi> might conclude, that Biſhops and Deacons were not then made without the Acceptation of the whole Church?</p>
            <p>It may be I ſhall be able to find out the meaning of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor; by his Reply to Dr. <hi>Owen:</hi> In that thus he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 86. <q>
                  <hi>Blondel</hi> made the peoples acceptation a <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> a neceſſary condition; affirming that Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were never conſtituted by the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical men, <hi>niſi</hi> unleſs they had this; which I ſuppoſe, makes the peoples acceptation praevious to the Apoſtles Act: For, if it followed after, it can be of no moment; the Act of the Apoſtles was compleat without it, and ſtood valid without it: and though it was moſt happy when it followed, yet ſtill this, as any other conſequent, muſt be accidental to the Conſtitution of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as that which <hi>advenit enti in actu exiſtenti,</hi> comes to it, when it is, is no way required to, or conſtitutive of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas no doubt, the Opinion of <hi>Blondel,</hi> that the Peoples conſent was praevions; but I do much queſtion, whether any ſuch thing can be inferred from the word <hi>niſi,</hi> uſed by him, <hi>p.</hi> 11. of his Apology; and I ſee not but that ſo much may be fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I do not ſay, the phraſe doth neceſſarily import ſo much; for I might properly ſay, that the King was Crowned <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though the Conſent of the City be not <hi>Conditio ſine qua non,</hi> of his Coronation: But if either Law or Cuſtom did require that the King ſhould not be Crowned <hi>except</hi> the City of <hi>London</hi> did conſent, then if I ſhould ſay that he was Crowned <hi>conſentiente amni Civitate,</hi> all would ſay and think my Meaning was, that the Conſent of the City was firſt asked, and obtained, before he was Crowned. Now this is our Caſe, we are ſure from the 6. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Apoſtles would not ordain any to the Office of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51480:23"/>Deacons, till the Diſciples had choſen them; nor do we find, that ever they did otherwiſe, except happily where God himſelf made the Choyce; therefore <hi>Clemens</hi> his Genitive put abſolutely, may well be thought to imply ſo much.</p>
            <p>But I need not much contend about <hi>Clemens</hi> his Meaning: <hi>Cyprian</hi> a very ancient Father and pious Martyr, is plainer then that he can be eluded.

But to let this paſs, one man, 'tis ſaid, muſt have the care of all the Churches, within a certain Precinct or Dioceſs: Well, but how big muſt this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct or Dioceſs be? Muſt it be the whole Chriſtian world, as the Pope ſaith, or will it ſuffice that it conſiſt of 2 or 3 Pariſh-Churches?</p>
            <p>For this I am told by Mr. <hi>Sandcroft,</hi> p. 21. <q>That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached the Goſpel not only in Cities, but in the Countries adjoyning, yet planted Churches in Cities ſtill, and ſetled ſingle perſons their Succeſſors there, to govern both the cities &amp; Regions round about (from whence a City &amp; a Church come to be equipollent terms, even in the Apoſtolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <gap reason="foreign">

And yet further, that they left the Churches of inferiour Cities, and their Biſhops in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Metropolis, which were the cheife according to the civill diviſion (and that the only true ground of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of one Church above another) hath been rendred as manifeſt as any thing almoſt in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, againſt all Adverſaries (both thoſe of the hils, and thoſe of the Lake too) by the Learned and well placed Labours of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſons in both pages of the <hi>Dipticks,</hi> whom I ſhall not need to name, ſince their own works praiſe them in the gate.</q> And p. 23. <q>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51480:25"/>of the Ancient Church, both Greek and Latine, and therefore the Twelfth Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> unmitred one <hi>Convildus,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly an Abbot in a little Village, and diſſolved the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick which <hi>Bamba</hi> the <hi>Gothick</hi> King had violently procured to be erected there, and that by this Rule of the Church; and the very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of my Text, which they actually plead in the Front of their Decree, to juſtifie their Proceedings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But (with reverence to ſo Learned a man be it ſpoken) much of this ſeems to be delivered with more Confidence then Truth. And indeed before we can gather the Divine Right of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Form of Government from Apoſtolical Practiſe, we muſt firſt prove the Univerſality of that Practiſe. We muſt evince, that not ſome few, but all the Apoſtles did ſo practiſe. Now I think it huge difficult, if not impoſſible, from any credible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, to make out what Order and Method was obſerved by all the Apoſtles in their planting of Churches, it being but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if any thing, that is ſaid by Hiſtorians, concerning ſome of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we could prove univerſality of Practiſe, we muſt alſo prove, that ſuch univerſal practiſe was not upon ſome grounds, proper and peculiar to thoſe Times in which the Apoſtles lived.</p>
            <p>Well, I for my part, will take no advantage from either of theſe two Conſiderations, but yet will give you my Reaſons, why I cannot look upon the Platform by him laid down, as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſavours ſtrongly of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both which were undoubtedly far from any one of Apoſtolical Spirit. For ſeeing the Goſpel was preached in Towns, as well as Cities, let us imagine, that by preaching of the Goſpel, five hundred were converted in a Town, but one hundred in a City, would it not be a ſinful accepting of perſons, to appoint the hundred Citizens a Biſhop, and to leave the five hundred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop? It matters not whether this caſe did ever actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happen, 'tis plain it might have happened, and we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>a poſſibili.</hi> And let any rational man ſay, whether it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that this is an Apoſtolical Inſtitution, that <hi>Peterborough</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> ſhould have a Biſhop reſident in them, <hi>Northampton, Leicester, Cambridge</hi> none.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:51480:25"/>
            <p n="2">2. This model is deſtructive to Epiſcopacy it ſelf, for if this be an Apoſtolical Inſtitution, that there ſhould be no Biſhops but in Cities, then if it ſhould ſeem meet to any Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to have no Cities in all his Territories, we muſt have no Biſhops; if he ſhould ſee meet to make all Cities equal, we muſt have no Archbiſhops or Metropolitanes: We know, that lately a certain thing, that called it ſelf the Supreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> did uncity <hi>Chester;</hi> ſuppoſe this had been done by a lawful Authority, ſo as that it could not have been recalled, the Church of <hi>England</hi> would have been loath to have loſt a Biſhop, yet ſhe muſt, if this be true, that no City, no Biſhop: Or what if our King, by the advice of his Councel, ſhould make every market Town in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> a City, muſt our Biſhops preſently be multiplied according to that proportion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis plain, that in one City there was more Biſhops then one, plain from Scripture, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To all the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus, which are at</hi> Philippi, <hi>with the Biſhops and Deacons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I know it is replyed, that <hi>Philippi</hi> was a Metropolis, and ſo in writing to the Biſhops in the plural, he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all the Biſhops in inferiour Cities, ſubject to that Metropolis: But I affirm, there is no ground for ſuch a reply, <hi>Philippi</hi> was not a Metropolis, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as we learn from <hi>Theophilact.</hi> But it is ſaid, this deſcription belonged to it as anciently it was, not as it was when the Apoſtle did write to them: If once it were no Metropolis, how can it be proved, that it was ſuch at the writing of this Apoſtolical Epiſtle; forſooth, from <hi>Acts</hi> 16.12. the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But this is too obſcure and ambiguous a place to build an opinion upon, the beſt Criticks not agreeing concerning the Syntax here uſed: If any thing can hence be gathered, that may prove <hi>Philippi</hi> a Metropolis, it will be either its being called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or its being <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: As for its being called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that will not prove any thing of that nature, for there is no neceſſity of rendring <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the chief City, it may as well ſignifie the firſt for ſcituation; this way very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men go, particularly <hi>Zanchius</hi> in his Commentaries on the <hi>Philip.</hi>

            <p>Againſt this it may be objected, that not <hi>Philippi,</hi> but <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> was the firſt City of <hi>Macedomia;</hi> but perhaps <hi>Neapolis</hi> was not <hi>urbs</hi> but <hi>pagus,</hi> perhaps it belonged rather to <hi>Thracia</hi> then <hi>Macedonia:</hi> Theſe two anſwers are hinted by <hi>Cauſabon,</hi> but a more ſatisfactory anſwer is ſuggeſted by <hi>Zanchius,</hi> I'le tranſcribe his words, though ſomewhat large, that the doubt may be wholly removed: Neapolis <hi>civitas eſt ad mare, ex adverſo Thraciae.

I anſwer, if it had been the only Colony in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> we might have thought it probable, that it was a Metropolis in the civil ſenſe, but it was not the only Colony, as is evident from Hiſtory. Further, the officers before whom <hi>Paul</hi> was brought, ver. 19, 20. of this Chap. make it ſomewhat more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Proconſul of <hi>Macedonia</hi> had not his reſidence at <hi>Philippi;</hi> and 'tis evident, that <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> was the Metropolis of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in the civil ſenſe: <hi>Theſſalonica Metropolis eſt, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norunt omnes Macedoniae;</hi> ſo we find it was in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe alſo; ſome hundred of years paſſed ere <hi>Philippi</hi> had the honorary title of a Metropolitan Church. Indeed, I think, I might have ſpared my ſelf and you all this trouble, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it never came into your head to think, that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writes to the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> he intended to write to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any more then the Chriſtians and Officers of that City of <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> for had he intended it to all the other Churches that were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51480:26"/>in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> then muſt the Epiſtle to the Church of the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> be intended to all the Churches of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and ſo the learned Annotator fears not to aſſert, that he may make the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <item>1.

                  </item>
                  <item>3. That ſometime there was but one Biſhop to many Cities, examples are too obvious and common to be produced: We in <hi>England</hi> are not without ſome Preſidents of this nature: If Councels be produced againſt this, you will remember, that Councels, moſtly conſiſting of Biſhops, they may be looked on as parties forward enough to eſtabliſh any thing that might make for their own pomp and grandure.</item>

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly; whereas it is ſo confidently affirmed, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did leave <hi>the Churches of inferiour Cities, and their Biſhops, in dependance upon the Metropolis:</hi> I do with ſome confidence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51480:27"/>reply, that there is no ſufficient proof for ſuch an aſſertion: I do not, in my poor reading find, that the proof of it from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath been much attempted, only he, whoſe diligence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wont to eſcape, argues, by comparing <hi>Acts</hi> 16.1.4. with <hi>Acts</hi> 15.2. I ſhall give you his words, as he himſelf hath Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed them to us. Anſ. to D. <hi>Owen;</hi> p. 195. <q>According to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Civil Government among the Jews, and the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in their Temple, the Apoſtles appear to have diſpoſed of Churches every where, and in all their plantations, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a ſubordination and dependance of the Churches in the inferiour Cities, to thoſe in the chief or Metropolis: An example of this we have in the ſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> concerning <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the ſeveral Cities thereof, in relation to <hi>Antioch</hi> the Metropolis; for when the queſtion <hi>Acts</hi> 15.2. was referred, and brought to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Church (peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly) of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Chap. 14.26. and 15.3. and the Decree of the Councel returned to them by whom the queſtion was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ver. 22. yet in the Epiſtle in which that Decree was contained, we find the Brethren through <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia, i. e.</hi> all the Chriſtians of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to be expreſſed and joyned with thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> v. 23. and after, when that Decretal Epiſtle was delivered to the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> v. 30. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> went over <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> v. 41, 42. and as they went, they delivered to every City the Decrees of the Councel, <hi>cap.</hi> 16.4. which is an evidence, that the Churches of thoſe Cities, related either immediately to <hi>Antioch,</hi> or as <hi>Antioch</hi> it ſelf did to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were in ſubordination to it, as to the principal Metropolis of ſo wide a Province, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I heartily wiſh this argumentation had been put into a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtical form, then it would have been eaſie enough to find out a Propoſition that might ſafely be denied: But ſeeing the Author hath not thought meet to put his diſcourſe into that dreſs, I ſhall not do it for him, leſt I ſhould be thought not to do it according to his mind: Taking it as we find it, I ſay:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which he ſuppoſeth, may well admit ſome diſpute, viz. <hi>Whether the queſtion referred to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>was referred to it by the ſingle Church of</hi> Antioch (<hi>but that as Metropolis of all</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria) for if it can be proved, that this reference was made only
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51480:27"/>by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that <hi>Antioch</hi> was Metropolis of all <hi>Syria,</hi> it will ſtill be unproved, that the reference was made by <hi>Antioch</hi> as Metropolis; for many things are done by a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Church, which are not done by it <hi>as ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There's no evidence, that the ground of the reference to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, becauſe that it was the principal Metropolis, more probable it is, that the reaſons of referring this controverſie to a determination at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were becauſe of the authority of thoſe Apoſtles that were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in which it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thoſe who contended with <hi>Paul</hi> would acquieſce, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Judaizing Teachers pretended the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles for their doctrine.</p>
            <p>Againſt theſe, let us examine what is objected; 'tis ſaid, page 204, 205. <hi>That the firſt taken alone could not be the reaſon, becauſe there being but two Apoſtles there at that time,</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John:

                  <item>4. <hi>The cauſe of the reference, was not only the contention of thoſe who came out of</hi> Judea, <hi>but the Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chean Chriſtians being taught,</hi> i. e. <hi>being ſeduced by them,</hi> Acts 15.1. <hi>and accordingly the Decree reſpected them peculiarly; and ſo this firſt reaſon is of no force.</hi>

                  <item>2. We'll grant it probable, that theſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizers did not only teach, but alſo had perſwaded ſome of the Antiochean Chriſtians to imbrace their errour: But then</item>
                  <item>3.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51480:28"/>the Apoſtolick Office, and ſo of equal authority with <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. yet their Apoſtleſhip might be more queſtioned by theſe Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Teachers, to ſtop their mouths, and let the Antiochean Chriſtians know, that they did not go about to aboliſh any thing which <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (who did moſtly converſe with thoſe of the Circumciſion) did reckon obligatory, this reference is made, this journey undertaken.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The learned Doctor ſeems not to deny, but that thoſe who came from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might pretend Commiſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from the Apoſtles to teach what they taught, but thinks this is uſeful, not diſadvantagious to him: For hence he thinks it follows, <hi>That if theſe certain men had been truly ſent and commiſſionated by the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>then this would have been of ſome force at</hi> Antioch, <hi>which it could not be, if</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och <hi>were perfectly independent from</hi> Jeruſalem, page 205. But who can ſwallow this? what Chriſtian doth not think, that if theſe men had come at that time into <hi>England,</hi> with a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to preach, that except we be circumciſed, we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it ſhould be of no force, becauſe we are a Church indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore we deny that the Decrees did therefore oblige the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> becauſe <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was their Metropolis, but becauſe the Decrees were made by Apoſtles, men acted by an infallible ſpirit, who could not but know the mind of Chriſt their Lord and Maſter: Such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees did concern and oblige all Chriſtians that had any certain knowledge of them, whether they were under the Metropolis of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or no.</p>
            <p>My ſecond argument, to prove that Epiſcopacy is not of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, ſhall be taken from the teſtimonies of thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who do clearly, and plainly make it to be but of humane inſtitution. I begin with <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Commentaries on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> made <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 387. <hi>Sicut Presbyteri ſciunt ſe ex Eccleſiae conſuetudine ei qui ſibi praepoſitus fuerit, eſſe ſubjectos, ita Epiſcopi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verint ſe magis conſuetudine, quam diſpoſitionis Dominicae veritate, Presbyteris eſſe majores.</hi> In his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius, Quod autem unus poſteà electus eſt, qui caeteris praeponeretur, in Schiſmatis remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um factum est, ne unuſquiſ<expan>

            <p>To anſwer that, the Councel follows <hi>Iſidore,</hi> and <hi>Iſidore</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>Hierome,</hi> and ſo all three make but one ſingle teſtimony, is too eaſie a way of anſwering, not worth taking notice of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are further told:
<list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>Ignatius</hi> is a more conſiderable Author then <hi>Hierome,</hi> and that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> all along his Epiſtles, bears witneſs to <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:</hi> I acknowledge more reverence is due to <hi>Ignatius</hi> then to <hi>Hierome,</hi> becauſe he lived neerer the age of the Apoſtles: But then 1.

                  <item>2. <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth no where, that I can find, aſſert the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy; and yet I have read over all <hi>Ignatius</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, and read them over with an impartial deſire to find out any thing from which I might collect what was the ancient form of Diſcipline: I am confirmed, that I was not miſtaken, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſſertations of the very learned Dr. <hi>H. Hammond:</hi> The ſecond of thoſe four diſſertations, is concerning <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and his teſtimonies, the whole 25th Chap. of that diſſertation, is taken up in producing teſtimonies out of that holy Martyr, and bleſſed Father in favour of <hi>Hierarchy:</hi> In the 26 Chap. he gives us the opinion of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in ſix concluſions. The ſecond is, <hi>Epiſcopos ſingulares, per omnes mundi plagas ubicunque Chriſtiana fides viguit, Chriſto ſi non praecipiente, ſaltem approbante, institutos fuiſſe:</hi> But wot you how he proves this concluſion? why, he proves it but by one teſtimony out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, the words, as by him quoted, are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But 1. Theſe words are not to be found in the old Greek Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> Now ſeeing this Doctor doth himſelf, in ſome particulars, prefer other Editions to the Edition of <hi>Iſaac

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Laurentian</hi> Copy doth not exhibit the words, as they are by the Doctor repreſented to us, for in it I find not <gap reason="foreign">

I can give the Doctor his own reading, and yet the place will not make for him, for a ſenſe different from that which he affixeth to them, may be given of them, and is given by Maſter <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> page 309. And all this, you know, by a friend of ours, was aſſerted in a Latin ſuppoſition at a publick act in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> four or five years ago.

            <p>But if this firſt anſwer ſucceed not, we are further told, that <hi>Hierome</hi> is not againſt the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it; or elſe, if one while he be againſt it, at another time he is for it.

               <hi>traditio Apostolica</hi> need not ſignifie that which was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, it may denote no more then an Eccleſiaſtical cuſtom.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But can there be any reaſon to imagine that <hi>Hierom</hi> or any man ſhould ſet down that for an Inſtance of Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the ſame perſon doth not believe to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles, but to be of a later Date? <hi>Anſw.</hi> to <hi>Lond. Miniſt.</hi> 176.</q> Why ſure a reaſon may well be imagined, as well as there may be a reaſon imagined, why Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> cals thoſe ancient Conſtitutions and Canons, <hi>Canons and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Apostolical;</hi> though he do not think, that they were either of them made by the Apoſtles, but by perſons far inferiour to them, for Authority, and born long after they were fallen aſleep. It was not unuſual to call that an Apoſtolical Tradition, which had been long practiſed. To this end, let Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi> be read in his Liberty of Propheſying, <hi>ſec.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 88, 89.2. He anſwers, that <hi>Hier.</hi> intended not here a particular and disjoyned Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, firſt of Biſhops with the High Prieſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> then of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and Laſtly of Deacons with <hi>Levites:</hi> but his meaning is, that as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons the Prieſts were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Levites;</hi> So under the New Teſtament, the Biſhop and Presbyter are above Deacons: And therefore it was intolerable Pride in the Deacon of his age, to ſet himſelf above the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Audio quendam in tantam erupiſſe vecordiam ut Diaconos Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteris,</hi> i. e. <hi>Epiſcopis anteferret.</hi> So he begins his Epiſtle; and in the Proceſs of it, he doth <hi>magno conatu,</hi> labour to prove, that Presbyters are the ſame with Biſhops: and at laſt concludes with theſe words, <hi>ut ſciamus Traditiones Apoſtolicas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place urged out of <hi>Hierom,</hi> to prove the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, is in his Comment on <hi>Titus; Idem eſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Presbyter qui &amp; Epiſcopus, &amp; antequam Diaboli inſtinctu, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia in religione fierent, &amp; diceretur in populis, ego ſum Pauli, ego Apollo, ego autem Cephae, communi Presbyterorum conſilio Eccleſiae gubernabantur, poſtquam vero unuſquiſ<expan>

            </p>
            <p>Before this can any way advantage the pretenſions of thoſe who aſcribe a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> to Epiſcopacy, it muſt be proved, that the <hi>in toto orbe decretum eſt</hi> doth refer to ſome Decree made
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51480:30"/>by the Apoſtles, and that the time of the Inſtitution of Biſhops was when it was ſaid at <hi>Corinth, I am of Paul,</hi> &amp;c. Now that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe will ever be proved, you will ſoon ſee, if you read the Annotations of <hi>Blondel</hi> on the Text of <hi>Hierom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I paſs now, having only begged your pardon for my prolixity in this Second, unto a Third Argument for proof of the validity of an Ordination by Presbyters; it ſhall be drawn from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and thus I form it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If among the</hi> Jews <hi>any one that was ordained himſelf, might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain another, then may Presbyters ordain Presbyters:</hi> But, <hi>among the</hi> Jews, <hi>any one that was himſelf ordained, might Ordain others:</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of the Major is founded upon that which is acknowledged by moſt Learned men, that the Government of the Church-Chriſtian was formed after the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pattern; Chriſt all along accommodating and lightly changing the Jewiſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes into Chriſtian Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The Minor I prove, there was among Jews, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>Harm.</hi> p. 97. an Ordination with laying on of hands, and without laying on of hands. <hi>Maym. in Sanhed.</hi> 4. <q>How is Ordination to be for perpetuity? Not that they lay on their hands on the head of the Elder, but call him <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and ſay, behold thou art Ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> But there was alſo Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the laying on of hands. Take Ordination which way you will, 'twill never be proved, that he who was himſelf in Office, might not ordain another to the ſame Office. For though we are told of a Conſtitution, that none ſhould ordain, but thoſe to whom leave was granted by <hi>Rabbi Hillel,</hi> yet <hi>a principio non fuit ſic.</hi> To which purpoſe, I ſhall only need to tranſcribe the words of <hi>P.

Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his ſix Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>p.</hi> 344, 345, 346, 347. muſtereth up many Inconveniences, which ſeemed to him, neceſſarily to follow this Conjecture or Obſervation. I cannot think my ſelf obliged to defend Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> The Reverend Doctor granteth as much as I would wiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 349. <q>That the Government of the Church was formed after the Jewiſh Pattern: And <hi>p.</hi> 324. That Impoſition of hands in Ordination, ſo often mentioned in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is anſwerable to the laying on of hands uſed by the Jews, when they did create Succeſſors in any Power, or communicate any part of their Power to others as aſſiſtants.</q> If all this be true, why may not a Chriſtian Presbyter ordain a Presbyter, as well as a Jewiſh Elder ordain an Elder?</p>
            <p>My Fourth Argument to prove the validity of Ordination by Presbyters, ſhall be taken from the many Examples that do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51480:31"/>in Antiquity of ſuch Ordinations, which were never reputed null and voyd.</p>

            <p>But the Queſtion is not, what might be done, but was done?</p>
            <p>And <hi>Eutychius</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> moſt plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely affirms, that from the time of <hi>Mark</hi> the Founder of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> unto <hi>Demetrius</hi> Biſh. of the ſame Church, the ſeveral Patriarchs of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> were choſen and ordained with Impoſition of hands, by the 12 Presbyters, and that by ſpecial command from St. <hi>Mark</hi> himſelf.

            <p>And from him, we ſhall go, to thoſe who ſpeak concerning the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in her firſt Converſion. <hi>Jo.

            <p>Now that I am upon the Iſle of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> it will not be amiſſe, to take notice what <hi>Walſingham</hi> the Monk relates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Lollards, A.</hi> D. 1389. <q>Winning very many to their Sect, they grew ſo audacious, that their Presbyters, like Biſhops, created &amp; ordained new Presbyters; affirming that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſt had received as much power to bind &amp; looſe, &amp; to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter other Eccleſiaſtical things, as the Pope himſelf giveth, or could give. This Power of Ordination they exerciſed in the Dioceſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and thoſe who were ordained by them, thinking all things to be lawful to them, preſumed to celebrate Maſſes, and feared not to handle divine things, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I might alſo reckon up the Ordinations made by the <hi>Chorepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi,</hi> among Ordinations by Presbyters: For I am not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by all that is written, that they were Biſhops. See what is ſaid in this matter by <hi>Forbes Irenicum,</hi> lib. 2. c. 11. Nor do I yet believe that the Sayings of thoſe two Ancient Authors, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Aegyptum Presbyteri conſignant, ſi praeſens non ſit Epiſcopus. In Alexandria &amp; per totum Aegyptum, ſi deſit Epiſcopus, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat Presbyter:</hi> are impertinently alledged to prove Ordination by Presbyters. For I judge it more probable that <hi>conſignare</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51480:32"/>
               <hi>conſecrare</hi> do ſignifie <hi>ordinare,</hi> then that they ſhould ſignifie only <hi>conficere Sacramentum Euchariſtiae,</hi> But let theſe paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſianus</hi> as you may find in <hi>Blondel,</hi> p. 357. reports, that <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anutius</hi> a Presbyter, did make <hi>Daniel</hi> his Diſciple firſt Deacon, then Presbyter, the Biſhops that at that time governed the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>And for Examples of latter times, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> will furniſh you in his Unbiſhopping of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, I thus prove the validity of Ordination by Presbyters, <hi>If the Ministry of thoſe who have been Ordained by Presbyters, hath been ordinarily bleſſed to the Confirmation and Converſion of ſouls, then is Ordination by Presbyters valid:</hi> But <hi>the Miniſtry of thoſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſequence of the Major is proved, becauſe God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any way more eminently atteſt and own the Miniſtry of any perſon, then by making him inſtrumental to the Converſion and Confirmation of the ſoules of his Hearers and Followers.

            <p>As for the Minor, if any one ſhould be ſo monſtrouſly uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and impudent, as to deny it, he need only enquire in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51480:32"/>
               <hi>Germany, Holland, France, Scotland,</hi> and he will hear of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Thouſands of Examples to convince him. As for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it hath been the ſad complaint of many, that God hath of late much withdrawn his converting preſence from his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But hath he more withdrawn it from his Ordinances ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by thoſe that were Presbyterianly ordained, then from the ſame Ordinances adminiſtred by ſuch as were Epiſcopally Ordained? Nay, hath not the ſucceſs of Presbyterians been greater, if their Adverſaries ſhould be Judges? Were it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to boaſt, many of us could ſay <hi>invenimus Eccleſiam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti lateritiam, reliquimus marmoream.</hi> We had prophane, rude ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people left us by our Epiſcopal Predeceſſors; but our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors will find them civil, knowing, praying Chriſtians. Might we but find ſo much Favour in the eyes of our Soveraign, as to be permitted to exerciſe our Miniſtry, if at the years end it did not appear, that we and our People were as good Subjects to God and his Vice-gerent, as any that favour the Hierarchy, we would not then refuſe to ſuffer the puniſhments due to men real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as bad as we are falſely reported to be: But if we muſt, becauſe we cannot embrace an opinion which was never till of late maintained by any that called himſelf a Proteſtant, be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, nothing remaines, but that we commit our cauſe to God, and till he ſee meet to plead it, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe our ſouls in Patience.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Objections againſt the validity of a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ordination, to be removed, and then I ſhall exerciſe your Patience no longer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is grounded upon the Authority of two Fathers, <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom: Hieroms</hi> words are in his Epiſtle to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrius, Quid enim facit Epiſcopus, excepta Ordinatione, quod non faciat Presbyter?</hi> To anſwer this Teſtimony, I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that they who produce it, will not ſtick to it, but are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded that there are many things beſides Ordination, which a Biſhop may do, that yet a Presbyter cannot do. But I need not flee to ſo indirect an Anſwer: For,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Marſilius Patavinus,</hi> in his Book which he cals <hi>Defenſor Pacis,</hi> takes the word <hi>Ordinatio</hi> to ſignifie quite another thing then the conferring of Holy Orders. His words are theſe; <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatio

                  <item>2. 'Tis certain that ſomtimes the word <hi>Ordinatio</hi> doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the external Rite or Ceremony uſed in Ordination, <hi>viz.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands; if ſo it be taken here, as why may it not?

                  <item>4. I finally anſwer, that <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks not here of any Divine Law appropriating Ordination to Biſhops, but only of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cuſtom that obtained in his age; 'tis as if he had ſaid, what is there now adaies done by a Biſhop, that a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter may not do without Breach of Eccleſiaſtical Canons, except only the buſineſs of Ordination? He had before ſaid, that <hi>a principio non fuit ſic,</hi> originally the Presbyters might and did make the very Biſhop himſelf.</item>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they exceed the Presbyter in the Power of Order only not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Juriſdiction. 2. I could much weaken the Authority of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> as to the point of Ordination by acquainting you that it was one of the accuſations made againſt that Father, that he did engroſſe Ordination to himſelf, not taking in the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Presbyters, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51480:33"/>of his Charge in the Synod <hi>ad Quercum,</hi> An. 403. But if theſe two Anſwers ſeem to you but ſhifts, (though why they ſhould ſeem no more then ſhifts, I wot not) I reply thirdly, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the word uſed by <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is ambiguous, uſed by good authors in very different, if not quite contrary ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as is noted (among others) by <hi>Suidas,</hi> his words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. (that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> here, ſeeing it hath an Accuſative caſe after it, Biſhops muſt from hence be concluded not lawfull poſſeſſors, but uſurpers of the power of ſole Ordination.</p>
            <p>If yet you are not ſatisfied, I turn you over fourthly to <hi>Gerſom Bucer,</hi> who page 357, 358. takes notice of this authority, as placed by Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> in the margin of that Sermon which he took upon him to confute; one of his anſwers is, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are here made Superiour to Presbyters, only by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary election of their Sym-Presbyters, or Colleagues, not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divine Right, he renders the words thus, <hi>Sola-enim horum (ſubaudi Presbyterorum) electione aſcenderunt, at<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> hoc tantum plus quam Presbyteri videntur habere;</hi> then the plain meaning is, that the Presbyters, for order ſake, do chuſe ſome one to be their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; and this is all that the Biſhop hath above the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>The ſecond objection againſt the validity of Ordinations by Presbyters, is taken alſo from Eccleſiaſtical Writers, among whom we do find Ordinations by Presbyters pronounced null and void: Of this nature there are three principally inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which before we particularly examine, I ſhall crave leave to premiſe this one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is very manifeſt, that Councels have pronounced ſome Ordinations null and void, which yet could not be null in <hi>natura rei.</hi> I inſtance only in the Councels of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> pronouncing Ordinations, though made by a Biſhop to be void, if the perſon ordained, were ordained either without a title, or in another Biſhops Dioceſs, yet ſuch Ordinations are not nullities, many examples of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are brought by the learned <hi>Blondell,</hi> page 168, 169. Now ſo it might be in the caſe of Ordinations by Presbyters, and ſo it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51480:34"/>is by many averred that it was; but let us hear the examples.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Colythus,</hi> a Presbyter, took upon him, being but a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, to ordain <hi>Iſchiras,</hi> this <hi>Iſchiras,</hi> notwithſtanding this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, was looked upon but as a <hi>Laick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, there are ſo many diſſimilitudes betwixt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Colythus,</hi> and thoſe Ordinations made by Presbyters, which we contend for, that from the condemning of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, no argument can be drawn to prove, that ours ought to be condemned.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Colythus</hi> acted not as a Presbyter, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended himſelf to be a Biſhop, ſo do not our Presbyters.</item>
                  <item>2. He acted alone, whereas our Ordinations are not by one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</item>
                  <item>3. He was an open declared Heretick.</item>
                  <item>4. He that was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained had no title, he was not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: He was not choſen by any Church, but our Ordinations are not of <hi>ſine</hi>-titular perſons.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond example is the caſe of <hi>Maximus,</hi> who being no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, yet ordained Presbyters, but all his Ordinations were by the Fathers aſſembled in Councel at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> pronounced null.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>  The ſtory of <hi>Maximus</hi> is too large to be here recited, ſee it in <hi>Blondell:</hi> I ſay briefly, that what was by the Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined againſt his Ordinations, is not prejudicial to Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by Presbyters, for (as <hi>Blondell</hi> well) if Presbyters had never ſo full power of Ordination, yet had the Synod good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to depoſe thoſe who were ordained by <hi>Maximus,</hi> becauſe he was a Presbyter, as well as a Biſhop in the ayr, never had he been ordained Presbyter, either by <hi>Gregory,</hi> or any other.</p>
            <p>A third example, is that of the blind Biſhop, who did lay hands on one Presbyter, and two Deacons, but his Ordinations were pronounced invalid, becauſe not he, but his Presbyters read the words of Ordination.</p>
            <p>This was decreed, ſaith Dr. <hi>J. Tay.</hi> Epiſcopacy aſſerted, 182. by the firſt Councel of <hi>Sevill,</hi> too haſtily, for it was done not by the firſt, but ſecond Councel of <hi>Sevill,</hi> about the year 619. He that reads the Decree of thoſe Fathers, would think they were blinder then the deceaſed Biſhop, whom they condemned; for what if the Presbyter did at the command of his Biſhop read the words which the Biſhop could not read, doth this make the Ordination void? by what Law, either of God, or man; ſhall we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51480:34"/>ſay, that the Judge with us doth not condemn the malefactor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he appoints the Clerk to read the ſentence? Be it as it will, the Decree it ſelf ſaith, that the Presbyter in reading the words, did only ſin <hi>contra eccleſiaſticum ordinem;</hi> and we cannot think that an Ordination is preſently void, becauſe all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Rites are not obſerved in it.</p>
            <p>Againſt theſe examples I might, if it were needful, bring the judgement of <hi>Leo, Anno</hi> 452. in his Epiſtle to <hi>Ruſticus Narbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> but in this Maſter <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> hath prevented me, page 380.</p>
            <p>The third objection againſt the validity of an Ordination by Presbyters, is taken from the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. without contradiction, the leſs is bleſſed of the better.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>  This is ſo poor and pitiful an objection, that I ſhould never have named it, had I not found it in the writings of ſome famous for learning. When it is ſaid, that the leſs is bleſſed of the greater, would they inferre, that he who ordains, muſt be greater then he who is ordained, is before or after Ordination; if he muſt be greater then he is after Ordination, then a Biſhop may not ordain a Biſhop, if they ſay he muſt be greater then the party is before his Ordination; why ſo, I hope, a Presbyter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a Presbyter, is greater then the Presbyter ordained by him, till he be actually ordained, and ſo brought into the ſame order with him.</p>
            <p>But I muſt come to that argument in which Dr. <hi>H. Ham.</hi> doth ſo triumph, that he confeſſeth he was not acute enough to ſee what could be replied to it, you will find it in his praemonition to the Reader, before his Latin Diſſertations, he frames it into a <hi>Dilemna,</hi> either <hi>Hierome</hi> had power to Ordain, or he had not, if he had, why then doth he ſay, <hi>Quid facit Epiſcopus excepta or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatione quod non faciat Presbyter;</hi> if he had not, how come our Presbyters to have that power, which he the <hi>Hyperaſpiſtes</hi> of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters had not.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Hierome</hi> had power to Ordain, taking in other Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to his aſſiſtance; what he meant by his <hi>Quid facit excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Ordinatione,</hi> I told you before.</p>
            <p>But the ſame learned <hi>Doctor</hi> proceeds, It ſhall ſuffice us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee of one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that no Presbyter Ordained by Biſhops here in the Engliſh Church, had any power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51480:35"/>others beſtowed on him, and therefore can no more take any ſuch power to himſelf, then can a Deacon, or a meer La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick.</p>

               </label> This profound Objection was, as you know, brought at a publick Act in <hi>Oxon.</hi> ſome years ſince, and urged by a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor, againſt one who maintained the validity of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Ordination, it was then, in the judgement of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſatisfactorily anſwered, and ſo, I doubt not, but it will be now in your judgement: I ſay, thoſe Biſhops who Ordained Presbyters here in <hi>England,</hi> did give them a power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, whether they had any intention ſo to do, I know not, but this I ſay, that he who maketh any one a Prieſt, giveth him a Power of Ordaining, and if when he is made a Prieſt, he ſhould through fear or ignorance promiſe not to Ordain, if he ſhould afterwards be convinced, that as Prieſt he hath a power of Ordaining, he ought to repent of his promiſe, and it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to joyn with his brethren in laying on of hands, if either there be no Biſhops, or none that will ordain, without impoſing ſuch ſubſcriptions, as contain in them matters very doubtful, if not unlawful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The form of words uſed in ordaining a Presbyter in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is this, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins thou remittest,</hi> &amp;c. did theſe words, when uſed by our Lord Chriſt to his Diſciples, confer a power of Ordaining? If they did not, I then demand when, and by what form of words was that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conferred on the Apoſtles? If they did, how come they not to convey a power of ordaining others unto the Presbyter, in whoſe Ordination they are uſed? If a man, when he is made a Prieſt in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> receive not a power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, nor doth he receive it when he is conſecrated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, for having read over the Form appointed for the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Biſhop, I cannot find any words that give the Biſhop a power of Ordaining, except any one be ſo hypercritical, as to imagine, that <hi>Take the Holy Ghoſt</hi> impowers a perſon to Ordain, and <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth not: But why then do Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians complain, that the Biſhops reſerve the power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Juriſdiction to themſelves, indulging to Presbyters only ſome inferiour Acts <hi>(ab omni excuſatione eos procul eſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludimus, qui, quas ſibi neutiquam conceſſas conquerantur, poteſtates,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51480:35"/>ſibi ſic ſacrilege arripiunt.) A.</hi> Presbyterians do not complain, that they had ſuch an Ordination as did not confer on them a power of Ordaining, but they complain, that they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the exerciſe of that power; nor do they ſay, that they have no power to ſuſpend and excommunicate, but that they are not ſuffered to put forth that power, but only (which the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt Church-Warden may do) to preſent ſcandalous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>But it is further objected, <hi>That when one is by the laying on of the hands of the Biſhop, advanced to the degree of a Presbyter, an indeterminate and indefinite power is not by the Fathers of the Church committed to him, but a power,</hi> ſuis finibus fiquido diſpuncta, ſuis cancellis &amp; limitibus diſtincta, &amp; dilucida actuum ſpecialium ad quos admittitur enumeratione definita &amp; concluſa; <hi>there is a particular enumeration of all the Acts unto which the power of a Presbyter doth extend, among which there is no mention of creating of Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> D.<hi>H.H.</hi> in his preface to his Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

            <p>But methinks after all this, I hear you ſay, you are not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe that when you talk with Epiſcopal men, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly tell you, that in receiving Ordination from Presbyters, you go againſt the judgement of the Catholick Church for 1600 years and upward. Let me ask you who are thoſe Epiſcopal men that tell you ſo? are they ſuch as you can ſuppoſe to have read the moſt conſiderable books that were written in all ages of the Church? For my part I have uſually obſerved that thoſe who thus boaſt of all Antiquity, are very ſtrangers to all Antiquity, and never ſo much as ſaw the Fathers and Councels they ſo prate of. If you are reſolved to cloſe with every one that ſaith he hath all the Fathers on his ſide, you muſt preſently turn Papiſt, for who more pretends Antiquity for his opinions than doth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt? But if you will not beleeve every one that pretends to have all Antiquity on his ſide, then I hope you may think it reaſonable to examine the Epiſcoparians pretences to Antiquity; which if you will do, you will find that prime Antiquity is no friend to ſuch an Hierarchy as they now would obtrude upon us. My ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you is,
<list>
                  <item>1. That if it be poſſible, and as much as in you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, you would avoid all Diſputations of this nature, which I have but rarely obſerved to have any good ſucceſs.</item>
                  <item>2. If you cannot avoid Diſputation, then if it be poſſible confine your diſpute to Scripture times: Put him that contends for Epiſcopacy as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as if the very being of the Church did depend upon it, to prove the Divine Inſtitution of it; and aſſure your ſelf, that which cannot be proved out of the Scriptures, is not neceſſary to the being of the Church;</item>
                  <item>3. If you muſt needs enter into the liſts about the Antiquity of your Opinion, then my counſell is,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51480:36"/>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Do not take every thing to be the ſaying of a Father, which is quoted as ſuch, but forbear anſwering, till you have time to examine whether that be indeed in the Fathers, which is brought out of them: For nothing is more common than for men in the heat of Diſputation, to lay the brats of their own brain at the Fathers doors.</item>
                        <item>2. If you find that which is produced out of any Father, to be indeed in him, then enquire whether it were the intent of the Father to deliver his mind in that place concerning that matter, for which his authority is urged. For if we will gather the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Fathers from paſſages let fall on the by, we may eaſily make one Father contradict another, yea every Father contradict himſelf.</item>
                        <item>3. You muſt alſo enquire, whether what a Father delivers, be delivered by him as his own private opinion, or as the opinion of the Church; and if as the opinion of the Church, whether only as the opinion of that part of the Church in which he lived, or of the Univerſal Church: If it be but his own private opinion and judgement, you cannot think your ſelf obliged to believe it, except confirmed by ſtrength of reaſon and evidence of Scripture. If it be delivered as the opinion of the whole Church, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is to be given to it; but then it is certain that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did <hi>humanum aliquid pati,</hi> and ſometimes affirm that to be Doctrine of the Church Univerſal, which was far enough from being ſuch. Theſe and many other directions are given to you by the Incomparable <hi>D'aillee</hi> in his learned Treatiſe of the <hi>Right uſe of the Fathers,</hi> which Book is moſt heartily recommended to your reading, as you are to the grace of God and guidance of his Spirit, by, Sir,</item>

            <p>VVHilſt I was waiting for a fit Meſſenger to ſend you theſe Papers, ſomthing fell out which is like to multiply your trouble, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Humf.</hi> Book of Re-ordination came to my hands, wherein he diſputes, <hi>Whether a Miniſter ordained by the Presbytery may take Ordination alſo by the Biſhop?</hi> and determines the queſtion affir. I was the more deſirous to read over his Book, becauſe I find him in the very 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pag. intimating, <hi>That ſince he had ſuffered himſelf to be re-ordained, it hath pleaſed God to exerciſe his Spirit with many perplexities, and that he doth not ſee what end the Lord had with him in his thoughts and workings of that nature, unleſs it be that theſe throws, as it were, of his be for the delivery of ſomthing for one or other of his Brethrens ſatisfaction.</hi> M. <hi>Humf.</hi> being a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and having ſought God often upon his knees for direction, it would be ſomwhat unchriſtian to adhere to my former determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation without ſo much as conſidering what he had written and printed againſt it. And if I know any thing of my ſelf, I am able to ſay, that I come to the examination of his Papers without the leaſt prejudice againſt his Perſon or againſt his Tenent. Nay I can ſafely ſay, that I am hugely deſirous to be his Proſelyte. But the <hi>eminent Mirandula</hi> hath taught me that which I alſo experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally find, <hi>nemo credit aliquid verum praeciſe quiavult credere illud eſſe verum, non eſt enim in potentia hominis facere aliquid appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere intellectui ſuo verum, quando ipſe voluerit.</hi> Though I would fain think it lawful to be re-ordained, yet unleſs my Arguments to prove it unlawful, be anſwered, I ſhall never be able to change my mind.</p>
            <p>This Learned Presbyter, <hi>p.</hi> 3. plainly tels us, that <hi>repeating or doubling of Ordination is odd and uncouth in its firſt and naked conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he affirms, that <hi>he dare not juſtifie our Church-Rulers in the impoſing of it.</hi> (by the way he may do well to conſider, whether his over-haſty ſubmitting to re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination be not a virtual, at leaſt interpretative juſtification of thoſe that require it.) But he faith alſo, that he puts it in the <hi>number of ſuch things as the neceſſity of convenience renders tolerable for the time,</hi> p. 5. <hi>Notionally he ſuſpects it is not good, but morally
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51480:37"/>he judgeth it an indifferent <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, good or bad, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally, as it is uſed.</hi> I will not now enter into the diſpute about things indifferent, but will rather then quarrel, grant this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Author, and Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> that as there are <hi>indifferentia ad utrumlibet,</hi> ſo there are <hi>indifferentia ad unum</hi> too, that is, <q>things which though they be neither univerſally good, nor abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil, yet being barely conſidered, ſway more or leſs rather the one way then the other. There are ſome things which of themſelves do notably and eminently incline unto evil rather then unto good; ſo that if the Queſtion were barely propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, whether they be evil, I could not be blamed if I did indefinitely anſwer, they are evil, which things yet in ſome caſes and circumſtances may be lawful.</q> But for the preſent I muſt deny to this judicious Brother, that the <hi>Re-ordination</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us to is ſuch a thing; as yet I think there is a <hi>moral evil</hi> in it, and not only a <hi>notional, phantaſtical</hi> or <hi>imaginary evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we might cloſe and joyn iſſue, but becauſe he tells us that in his firſt Paper he only made ſcattered <hi>efferts,</hi> and that he would more roundly and freely lay down his Opinion with a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger compaſs in the whole matter, <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. we will attend his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thither. His four firſt Propoſitions I aſſent unto. In his fifth, <hi>p.</hi> 18. he diſtinguiſheth between <q>what Ordination is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſetting apart a man to the Office of a Miniſter in the ſight of God, and what is requiſite to the making him received as a Miniſter among men, and give him Authority or full repute to exerciſe that Office in the Church or place where he ſhall be called.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He believes that Ordination by Presbyters ſufficing but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while ago to both, ſufficeth ſtill to the former, but ſeeing Ordination by a Biſhop is neceſſary to the latter, he thinks his being ordained by the Presbytery hinders not, but he may be again ordained by the Biſhop, becauſe he ſeeks not to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to make him a Miniſter again, but to have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to uſe his Miniſtry, and be received as ſuch <hi>in Foro Eccleſiae Anglicanae.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, I readily acknowledge, that he who is already a Miniſter, may betake himſelf to a Biſhop, or to any one elſe whom the Magiſtrate ſhall appoint, to procure <hi>a Licenſe to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Miniſtry quietly;</hi> but the queſtion is, <hi>Whether when I am
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51480:38"/>made a Miniſter, I may go and take another Ordination, and that the very Ordination which the Church uſeth, when thoſe who before were no Miniſters are made Miniſters.</hi> I encline to the Negative this Learned Caſuiſt to the Affirmative.</p>
            <p>In which Opinion he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 19. he is a little juſtified, <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he was ordained by the Presbytery, the very words uſed at the point were, <hi>Whom by the laying on of hands, we ſet apart to the Office of the Miniſtry;</hi> and in the Ordination by the Biſhop, they are, <hi>Take Authority to preach the Word and miniſter the Sacraments in the Congregation where thou ſhalt be appointed,</hi> that is, in thy place.</q> Sure this can but a little juſtifie him in his Opinion; for the words by him mentioned, are not all the words that were uſed in his Ordination by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: 'Twas then alſo ſaid, <hi>Receive thou the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſins thou remitteſt, they ſhall be remitted, and whoſe thou retaineſt, they ſhall be retained:</hi> and ſeveral Prayers were uſed, that did evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply him to be no Miniſter before.</p>
            <p>He ſaith in the ſame place, <q>that the words uſed in Epiſcopal Ordination, do confer the Miniſterial power to the un-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that hinders not, but rather argues, if they confer that, &amp; the other too, they may doubtleſs, (and actually do) conferre one (and can but the one only) to ſuch as are in his caſe.</q> All this ſure makes much againſt him; for if the Presbyterial Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leave him not capable of having any thing conferred upon him but only the free uſe of his Miniſtry in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, why will he ſubmit to ſuch a Form of Ordination, as was purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to confer the very Miniſtry it ſelf? Why is the Right Reverend troubled to do that which is already done? Why are ſuch Prayers put up to God as manifeſtly ſuppoſe me to be no Miniſter, when as I all the while ſuppoſe my ſelf to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Let Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> but procure us to be ordained in ſuch away, as ſhall only licenſe us to exerciſe that Miniſterial Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we already have, and to be prayed for with ſuch a Form of Prayer, whoſe tendency ſhall only be to implore a Bleſſing upon us in the uſe of that <hi>Sacerdotal Function</hi> we have already received, and then he need not doubt, but we ſhall moſt readily and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept of it. But till this be done, let him not blame us, if we keep our ground, and chuſe rather to loſe the exerciſe of our Miniſtry for a ſeaſon (which yet is an affliction heavier then
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51480:38"/>the Sands of the Sea) then to take <hi>gradum Simeonis</hi> (that I may allude to the Form of the Oath by which we are ſworn when we are made Maſters of Arts in the Univerſity.) Either I am miſtaken, or I have already ſuggeſted that which will help you to ſolve all Mr. <hi>Humfreys</hi> Arguments by which he laboureth to juſtified his ſubmiſſion to a Second Ordination.</p>
            <p>Let's try: <hi>p.</hi> 21. He querieth: <q>What evil is there more in re-ordination, then in ſecond Marrying? If it be required of me, why may I not be ordained twice as well as once, and thrice as well as twice, if there be ſtill reaſon ſufficient?</q> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>  No Queſtion if there be reaſon ſufficient, a man may be ordained every hour of the day; but there cannot be reaſon ſufficient for ordaining either a third or a ſecond time to the ſame Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end of Ordination is attained by one Adminiſtration of it, and the Church of Chriſt may do nothing in vain. As for the Inſtance of ſecond marrying, by it is either underſtood mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of a ſecond wife, when the firſt is dead, and if ſo, 'tis ſtrangely impertinent: Or elſe a ſecond ſolemnization of the former Marriage; and then I ſay that no wiſe man that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been married in a lawful way, will, or ought to ſubmit to ſuch a Form of Marriage as ſuppoſeth him all the time before, to have had no right to his wife: 'Tis one thing to go to a Juſtice or to a Biſhop, and to get an Inſtrument under his hand, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a mans ſelf, Wife and Children from moleſtation, another thing to go to the Congregation and be married with all the Prayers and religious ſolemnities appointed in the Common-Prayer-Book. I do not think, that Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> can produce any one inſtance of a perſon forced to a ſecond Marriage, that had been before validly married, though not according to the Canons in force. I deſire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whom I look upon as a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, that he would one time in his Study read over the Form of Marriage, and try whether it would not go much againſt the hair to uſe it to two perſons, who for many years had lived in Matrimony, and begotten Children.</p>
            <p>He proceeds in his Queries: <q>May not the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Supremacy be repeated, and yet Gods Name not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vain? Is it enough to make our Liturgy unlawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have in one Service the Lords Prayer twice over?</q>

But I for my part think not that it is ſimply unlawful to uſe the Lords Prayers twice in one Service; but how it will be hence inferred, that therefore it is not unlawful to repeat Ordination, I am not ſo quick-ſighted as to perceive: The things we pray for in the Lords Prayer are things which ſome of the congregation have not at all, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had need to have renewed, hence it is we uſe it often and if wee uſe it with faith and affection we have hope our uſing of it will not be in vaine, but as he that is in the ſtate of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; is perſwaded that he is in it, ſhould ſin if he ſhould pray to be put into it: ſo I think that he who is already by ordination made a Miniſter, ſhould ſin if he ſhould again pray to be made a Miniſter, or ſubmit to any other Divine Ordinance, the end whereof is to make a man a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>[ I read of one Baptiſm in Scripture and a ſtreſs is laid upon it, but I read not ſo of one Ordination: where there is no Law to the contrary, where I pray lies the Tranſgreſſion? ]</q> Juſt thus I have heard that one who is lately ſent into another world, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in the Pulpit, that he <hi>read of Unity, but never of Uniformity,</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But doth it indeed follow, that Ordination may be repeated, becauſe we do not find thoſe words, <hi>one Ordination</hi> in Scripture: Why, if we had read of one Ordination, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation might have been repeated notwithſtanding: For it is not therefore unlawful. To repeat Baptiſm (though upon other accounts the repetition of it be ſinful) becauſe it is ſaid one Baptiſm; for the unity there ſpoken of is not numerical, but ſpecifical. <hi>One</hi> is as much as <hi>common to all; non reſpicitur</hi> (ſaith <hi>Voſſius,</hi> in his <hi>Theſis de Anabaptiſ.</hi>) <hi>unitas uſurpationis, ſed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas partium ſubſtantialium, aquae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſc. &amp; verbi.</hi> But as I ſay, that Ordination might have been iterable, though we had read of one Ordination, ſo I ſay, that though we read no ſuch words as one Ordination, it may be uniterable, and that it is ſo, will appear, by the Arguments uſed in the Letter, and others ſuggeſted to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> if his Anſwers to them, or to any one of them prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument he brings againſt himſelf, is that of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, which he thus propounds, <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25. <q>Many Brethren do
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51480:39"/>think it unlawful to be ordained again, and by ſeeing ſuch an one as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> re-ordained, will be imboldned to do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; which if they do, whilſt they believe (or doubt) it to be unlawful, they periſh; and when we ſin againſt the Brethren, and wound their weak Conſcience, we ſin againſt Chriſt.</q> To this he anſwereth, <q>That if a man who is ſatisfied of a thing as indifferent and lawful, muſt yet forbear, upon the account that by his example, others may be emboldened to the ſame, who having not that knowledge, do judge it unlawful, and ſo ſin if they do it; then is the way of poor Chriſtians (the Lord knows) very ſtraight; and that he is through Grace ſomthing enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to judge, that a man may ſomtimes do much good in leading an example to the doubtful, when a thing is becoming neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>p.</hi> 26.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument is none of mine, &amp; therefore it need not much trouble me what becomes of it; nevertheleſs I think not meet to paſs it over without acquainting you a little with my thoughts concerning it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Methinks that of Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, <hi>p.</hi> 53, 54. hath a great deal in it, <hi>viz. We read not of ſcandals culpable in Gods Word, but there be ſome moral Reaſons in them.</hi> If there were no probable reaſon to imagine there were ſin in re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, I could not be under obligation to abſtain from it, for fear of offending my Brother: therefore do I not forbear to turn up the hour-glaſs, or to wear a Gown when I preach, becauſe there is not any apparent moral reaſon why either the one or the other ſhould ſcandalize, both the Glaſs and the Gown being of meer civil uſe, and having no moral influence in my preaching: For I uſe and may uſe my Glaſs and my Gown in reading an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity or Philoſophy-Lecture to Freſh men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do alſo judge that of <hi>Gregory de Valentia,</hi> to have truth and favour in it; that the Law for the avoyding of the ſcandal of a weak brother, doth not oblige us to forbear any thing, which cannot be forborn <hi>ſine maxima aliqua &amp; pene intolerabili difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;</hi> wherefore if it ſhould come to paſs, that I can neither preach nor have a livelihood unleſs I be re-ordained, I ſhould not ſtick to ſay that I were to ſubmit to re-ordination (ſuppoſing it be lawful) though thereby ſome through their ignorance or weakneſs, ſhould be ſcandalized. I would become any thing to any one, rather then loſe the opportunity of gaining ſouls. But
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51480:40"/>then firſt Mr. <hi>Humf.</hi> might do well to conſider, whether this neceſſity be not a neceſſity which he hath brought on himſelf and others. Poſſibly an humble and peaceable, but yet earneſt Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, might have prevented all this neceſſity of re-ordination. 2. He may do well to weigh this, whether he did before he took Orders a ſecond time, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſatisfie thoſe Brethren about him that were like to be ſcandalized by that his practiſe: For many things may be lawful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y done after we have given a reaſon, and laboured to prevent ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, which could not elſe be done without ſin.</p>
            <p>He proceeds <hi>p.</hi> 28. to that which is indeed the main Argument againſt re-ordination; which he thus propounds: Ordination is that which according to Divines, does give a man the Office of the Miniſtry, this is the end they account of Ordination: now when a man is Miniſter already, there is not this end. If there be not its end, it is to no purpoſe, an Ordinance of God taken in vain, which is againſt the Third Commandment. To this he anſwers, <hi>p.</hi> 29. <q>There are more ends then one in Ordination, as in Baptiſm and other Inſtitutions; it is not neceſſary to the taking or uſing an Ordinance, that a man be capable of all its ends (I might add if need were, nor the grand end) ſo long as there is ſome right and ſufficient end of the ſame.</q> To this, the Reply is not difficult: We eaſily grant, one may take or uſe an Ordinance, who is not capable of all its ends; but then he muſt take it in ſuch a Form of words as is expreſſive only of thoſe ends of which he is capable. I will illuſtrate my ſelf by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Marriage; one end of it is procreation, I queſtion not but he may marry, who in a natural way is not capable of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children, elſe muſt I condemn all the Marriages of aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (which I have no warrant to do.) But then this perſons dead body muſt be ſo far conſidered, as that no Prayer be put up of this nature, that God would bleſs him with Iſſue; elſe I tempt God, and pray unto him to work a Miracle: This, the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy thought upon, and therefore appoint the Prayer for Children to be omitted, in caſe there be no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hopes of Children. In like manner one that is ordained already, and ſo a Miniſter, he may be again ordained in order to the free exerciſe of his Miniſtry, but not ordained with that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, whoſe chief end is to give the very Miniſterial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Authority: He proceeds, <hi>p.</hi> 30.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:51480:40"/>
            <p>
               <q>The common and general end of Baptiſm was for Remiſſion of ſins, yet was Jeſus Chriſt baptized, who was not capable of that end, but ſome others.</q> True, our Lord Chriſt was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> but ſome ſay, that he was not baptized for himſelf; others ſay for himſelf; and theſe latter I judge have the Truth on their ſide: Why might he not uſe the Sacraments as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true Religion? as parts and acts of the Inſtituted Worſhip appointed by God? Yea, why might he not uſe them as Seals of the Divine Promiſes made to him as Mediator? Yea, why might he not uſe the Sacraments for the Confirmation of his Faith in theſe Promiſes? But let M. <hi>Humf.</hi> if he can prove that in the Baptiſme of Chriſt any words were uſed by <hi>John</hi> expreſſive of ſuch an end as Chriſt was not capable of. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>John</hi> uſed no Form of words. Some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and moſt Schoolmen think that he made uſe of this Form, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Meſſiah to come.</hi> If that were his Form, no ſober man I trow, will think that he kept that Form when he baptized the Meſſiah himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ibid. Paul</hi> is made a Miniſter by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. yet was he ordained after by the hands of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. 'Tis plain then, that a man who is a Miniſter already, may be ordained, or that it is not neceſſary to be ordained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this end, to have the Office conferred on him.</q>

<list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>Paul</hi> was before a Miniſter, and not only a Probationer and Candidate to that Office. Now this is denied by very Learned men, and the place <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. reconciled to their Opinion.</item>
                  <item>2. Or elſe it is ſuppoſed that <hi>Paul</hi> was now in the 13th. of the <hi>Acts</hi> made a Miniſter: But this alſo is denied by others.</item>
               </list>
The circumſtances of the Story make it more probable, that the laying on of hands mentioned, was rather Optative then Ordinative.</p>
            <p>Where as therefore we are bid <hi>p.</hi> 31. <q>tell the Biſhop, if he ſhould ask, wherefore wilt thou be Ordained? that we deſire to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to that end, that very end St. <hi>Paul</hi> was here ordained to.</q> I ſay, this is very good wholſom Counſel and Advice: But if the Biſhop will not uſe Means proper to that end, if he will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving me the Canonical ſtamp of Allowance, break in pieces my old Seal, and give me another, what muſt I do then?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51480:41"/>Why this Ingenuous Author hath found out a <hi>Salvo</hi> for that, <hi>pag.</hi> 51, 52. <q>If a man do both clearly and unfaignedly before and after this re-ordination declare himſelf, renouncing of his former Ordination, will not by the Lord, ought not by man, to be laid to his charge, and that upon this evident reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Expreſſion in this caſe doth give Conſtruction to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the denomination muſt be <hi>a fortiori,</hi> and there can be no doubt to the unbyaſſed, whether a manifeſt Declaration by mouth, or a dumb ſhew or act is the clearer, and ſo the ſtronger ſignification.</q> But poor dull I was wont to think, <hi>Proteſtatio non valet contra factum.</hi> If I ſhould take the Engagement, and plainly declare both before and after, that I intended not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or to go againſt either Covenant, or Oath of Allegiance, would this juſtifie me in the ſight of God or men? If it would, Monarchs have not ſo faſt hold of their Subjects, as I have alway deemed them to have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 42, 43. The Queſtion being only this at the higheſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <q>an Authority or Commiſſion to an Office or Work, in the Nature of the thing may be renewed or refreſhed? There is one Inſtance alone may, I think, pluck the ſuperſtitious doubt up by the root from the heart: The Apoſtles beyond queſtion, had Miſſion and Commiſſion, and ſo the Gift, whatſoever it is, from Chriſt, when he made them Miniſters in his Life, and yet we find their Commiſſion or Authority Miniſterial renewed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely again after Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. Which herein hath the more ſupport in it, that it is the ſame Form which is uſed to us, without repetition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How different are the apprehenſions of men? That which to him ſeemeth ſtrong enough to pull the ſuperſtitious doubt up by the root, to mee ſeems not to ſhake, or ſo much as touch the root: For it is judged by ſome, that the Commiſſion <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. was but temporary, and ſo expired upon the return of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: But I do not think, that the Presbyters ordained Mr. <hi>Humf.</hi> to be a Miniſter only till the Reſtitution of the Biſhops. 2. However all grant the Commiſſion then granted, was but partial, ſuch as did not authorize to all Miniſterial Acts, not to adminiſter the Euchariſt, not to abſolve Penitents, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Ordination by Presbyters was full and compleat, 'twas ſo thought by the Ordainers, 'twas ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51480:41"/>thought by the Ordained, and the people upon this Ordination received men as Miniſters, as compleat Miniſters, receiving all Ordinances from them, as occaſion offered it ſelf, and giving them the double honor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that all that can hence be inferred, is but this, that they who have only been made Deacons, may be made Presbyters, and of that there is no ſcruple made; but hence it follows not, that they who have been made Prieſts, and acted for ſome years as ſuch, may now be made Deacons again, and afterwards be made Prieſts, <hi>Quod crat Demonſtrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's but one thing more in all Mr. <hi>Humf.</hi> book that can trouble you, and that is about the Argument taken from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which may be put into this <hi>Enthymem, Baptiſme may not be repeated, therefore Ordination may not.</hi> The conſequent I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in my letter, and ſo proved it, as that what Mr. <hi>Hum.</hi> ſaith againſt it, will not much ſtagger you: he propounds ſomething therefore as to the antecedent, page 85, 86. <hi>Not accounting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurdity, that Baptiſme it ſelf ſhould be repeated, which he proves from</hi> Acts 19. <hi>where ſome ſeem to be baptized, that had been before baptized with</hi> John's <hi>Baptiſme, whereas</hi> John's <hi>Baptiſme was one with Chriſts, as to Author, matter, form, end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this deſerves to be well thought on, and ſoundly chewed, before we ſwallow it, leſt while we plead for Re-ordination, we alſo open a wide gap to Anabaptiſme; you muſt therefore know, that the Church of God, the Orthodox part of it, hath alway reputed rebaptization, not only ſuperfluous, but alſo impious: If <hi>Cyprian</hi> and ſome others, be produced to the contrary, 'tis upon a miſtake; they preſſed that which others thought would be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond baptiſme, not what they thought ſo; for baptiſme by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, was by them thought no baptiſme; the conſtant judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers, the not repeating of Circumciſion, the no example, the no precept for rebaptization, is ſufficient argument, that it is not the will of God, that baptiſme ſhould be iterated; this will of God is not irrational, nay, it is grounded, ſaith <hi>Voſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> upon reaſon, not unknown to us: <hi>Proprius enim baptiſmi finis est ut ſignet &amp; obſignet ſpiritualem Nativitatem noſtram ſive inſitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem in Chriſtum, &amp; receptionem in familiamejus; hoc in altero ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento quod eſt S.

            <p>The Councel alſo of <hi>Capua</hi> is againſt him, as I find in <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> the Epitomator of <hi>Baronius, ad annum</hi> 389. If Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> have a man for him, he hath an Army againſt him. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not ſee that <hi>Baldwin</hi> is for him, for he determines not, that a man who is ordained, and judgeth himſelf to be ſo, may take a ſecond Ordination, but only that he who is ordained, and is not ſatisfied in his own mind and conſcience about the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ordination, may be re-ordained, which caſe is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wide from the caſe of Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> for he thinks that he is ordained, and ſaith, he will tell the Biſhop ſo, yea, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to affirm, that his <hi>Dioceſan</hi> doth amiſs in calling him to theſe ſecond orders.</p>
            <p>Now truly, though I would not altogether baulk a way, becauſe no man did ever walk in it before me, yet I muſt take leave to ſuſpect ſuch a way, and conſider well before I venture into it: The Poet ſaith, <hi>Illi robur &amp; aes triplex circa pectus qui fragilem, &amp;c.</hi> He was a bold man, that did firſt expoſe himſelf to the Sea in a ſhip; and King <hi>James</hi> would ſay, that he had a good ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, who firſt eat an oyſter: May not we alſo think, that they, who ever they are, were too hardy, who were the firſt that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to re-ordination, which if it be no more, <hi>is Ordination redundant, a miſhape in our apprehenſion,</hi> page 4.</p>
            <p>Page 94. He ſuggeſts, <q>That if he ſhould not be re-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many of his people will not own him, but clamour, they will not receive the Sacraments from him, and perhaps they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51480:44"/>will make him Conſtable or Church-Warden?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Conſtable or Church-Warden! that were pity indeed; but yet better be either one or the other, then do that which is ſo deſtructive to communion of Churches, as re-ordination upon examination will appear to be: 'Tis not unlike ſome peeviſh people before this turn, might ſay, that Mr. <hi>Humf.</hi> was no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, becauſe not ordained by a Biſhop; but he did not then judge it any part of his duty to be re-ordained, that he might ſtop their mouths, how comes he now to be ſo tender of them: And I doubt ſome of the better ſort of our hearers, ſhould they underſtand that we are ſo light, as to take a non-ſignificant ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ſo ſolemn a way as we muſt do, if we come under the Biſhops hands, would be ſo ſcandalized, as ſcarce to account our Miniſtry worth attending on. Upon the whole I ſee not but that they who refuſe Re-ordination, may be reckoned among men of a tender frame, and ſerious ſpirit, and not among ſuch as are of a ſcanty ſoul, and too ſcrupulouſly ſuperſtitious conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>The Lord lead you by his Spirit into all truth, and after you have ſuffered for a while make you perfect.</hi>
